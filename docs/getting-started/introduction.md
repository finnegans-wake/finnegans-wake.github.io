# Welcome to Finnegans Wake

Welcome to the comprehensive resource for readers, scholars, and enthusiasts of James Joyce's *Finnegans Wake* (1939).

## What You'll Find Here

This site brings together the scattered resources of the Wake ecosystem into one navigable space:

- **Getting Started** — Begin your journey with essential context and reading strategies
- **Guides** — Deep dives into the structure, themes, language, and characters
- **Reference** — Annotations, concordances, and scholarly bibliography
- **Ecosystem** — Digital archives, audio resources, reading groups, and tools

## Why This Resource Exists

*Finnegans Wake* has generated an extraordinary scholarly apparatus over 85+ years. From Joseph Campbell's pioneering *A Skeleton Key* (1944) to FWEET's 101,670+ annotations, the resources exist—but they're scattered across the web, in out-of-print books, and behind institutional walls.

This site serves as a gateway: a curated, navigable guide to what exists and where to find it.
