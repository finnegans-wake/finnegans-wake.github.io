# First Steps

Ready to begin? Here are practical strategies for approaching *Finnegans Wake*.

## Before You Start

### Get the Right Edition

The standard edition is the **Viking/Penguin** edition (ISBN: 978-0141183114), which uses the same pagination as Roland McHugh's *Annotations*. This consistency is essential—all scholarly references use these page and line numbers.

### Gather Your Resources

At minimum, have access to:

1. **FWEET** ([fweet.org](http://fweet.org)) — Free, searchable database of 101,670+ annotations
2. **McHugh's *Annotations to Finnegans Wake*** — The essential companion (optional but highly recommended)

## Strategies for First-Time Readers

### 1. Read It Aloud

Joyce intended the Wake to be heard. Reading aloud:
- Makes the Irish English rhythms apparent
- Reveals puns hidden in spelling
- Mimics the experience of hearing a foreign language become comprehensible

Many passages that seem impenetrable on the page become clear when spoken.

### 2. Don't Stop to Look Up Everything

On a first pass, **keep moving**. The Wake works through accumulation and repetition. Themes and motifs recur throughout—what's obscure on page 10 may become clear by page 200.

### 3. Start with the "Easier" Sections

Some passages are more accessible entry points:

| Section | Pages | Why It's Accessible |
|---------|-------|---------------------|
| Anna Livia Plurabelle | 196-216 | Beautiful river language, clear narrative |
| Shem the Penman | 169-195 | Portrait of Joyce himself |
| The Washerwomen | 196-216 | Two women gossiping by the river |
| HCE's Defense | 532-554 | Relatively straightforward monologue |

### 4. Join a Reading Group

The Wake is better in community. Reading groups:
- Provide accountability
- Offer multiple perspectives on difficult passages
- Make the process enjoyable
- Have been reading the Wake since 1939

See [Reading Groups](/docs/ecosystem/reading-groups) for options.

### 5. Listen to Audio Versions

Hearing the text read by experienced readers transforms the experience:

- **Patrick Healy** — Fast-paced Dublin reading ([UbuWeb](https://ubuweb.com))
- **Patrick Horgan** — Slower, more measured
- **Waywords and Meansigns** — Complete text set to music ([waywordsandmeansigns.com](https://waywordsandmeansigns.com))

## A Suggested First Reading Plan

### Week 1-2: Orientation
- Read the opening pages (3-29) without annotations
- Listen to an audio version of the same section
- Read *A Skeleton Key* introduction or similar overview

### Week 3-4: Anna Livia Plurabelle
- Read pages 196-216 with FWEET annotations
- Listen to Joyce's own 1929 recording of this section
- Read critical commentary on this famous episode

### Week 5+: Continue
- Either continue linearly from page 3
- Or move to another "accessible" section
- Consider joining a reading group for accountability

## What "Understanding" Means

You will never "understand" the Wake the way you understand a conventional novel. This is intentional. Joyce created a text that:

- **Resists single interpretation** — Multiple valid readings coexist
- **Rewards rereading** — New discoveries on every pass
- **Changes with the reader** — Your experience deepens over time
- **Remains inexhaustible** — Even scholars find new connections after decades

The goal isn't mastery. The goal is engaged, pleasurable reading.

## Common First-Reader Mistakes

1. **Trying to understand every word** — Let some things wash over you
2. **Reading in silence** — Always try reading aloud
3. **Reading alone** — Community makes it better
4. **Expecting linear narrative** — Accept dream logic
5. **Giving up after 10 pages** — It gets easier (and harder, and easier again)
