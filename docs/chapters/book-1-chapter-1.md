## Synopsis

The chapter begins famously mid-sentence: "riverrun, past Eve and Adam's, from swerve of shore to bend of bay..."

### Key Events

2. **Finnegan's Fall** (4–7) — Tim Finnegan, a hod-carrier, falls from his ladder
3. **The Wake** (7–10) — His friends hold a wake; whiskey splashes on him; he revives

6. **HCE Emerges** (23–29) — Humphrey Chimpden Earwicker supplants Finnegan

## The Circular Opening

The book's first word, "riverrun," completes the final sentence fragment of page 628: "A way a lone a last a loved a long the..." Together they form:

> "A way a lone a last a loved a long the riverrun, past Eve and Adam's, from swerve of shore to bend of bay, brings us by a commodius vicus of recirculation back to Howth Castle and Environs."

This circular structure embodies:
- **Vico's cyclical history** — "commodius vicus" puns on Vico
- **The river's cycle** — River to sea to rain to river
- **Dream logic** — Dreams loop and repeat
- **Eternal recurrence** — The book never truly ends

## The First Thunderword

Page 3 contains the first of ten thunderwords—hundred-letter portmanteau words representing Vico's thunder that announces each new age:

> "bababadalgharaghtakamminarronnkonnbronntonnerronntuonnthunntrovarrhounawnskawntoohoohoordenenthurnuk!"

This word combines thunder sounds from many languages, announcing the Fall of man.

## Tim Finnegan and the Ballad

Joyce draws on the Irish-American ballad "Finnegan's Wake" (note the apostrophe Joyce removed):

- Tim Finnegan is a construction worker who drinks too much
- He falls from his ladder and is presumed dead
- At his wake, whiskey splashes on his corpse
- He rises, alive, asking "D'ye think I'm dead?"

This comic resurrection prefigures all the falls and rises in the book.

## Finnegan as Dublin

In death/sleep, Finnegan becomes the landscape:

> "His clay feet... at the knockingshop... while his... head... lies under... the great central... Wellington monumental."

- **Head**: Hill of Howth
- **Feet**: Phoenix Park (near Chapelizod)
- **Body**: Dublin itself

HCE will inherit this identification with the city.

## Key Themes Introduced

### 1. The Fall
Adam's fall, Finnegan's fall, HCE's fall, Humpty Dumpty's fall—all versions of the same primal event.

### 2. Death and Resurrection
The wake (funeral) becomes the Wake (awakening). Whiskey (Irish: *uisce beatha*, "water of life") revives.

### 3. The River
Anna Livia Plurabelle, personified as the Liffey, flows through everything.

### 4. The Guilty Father
HCE's crimes are hinted at—something happened in Phoenix Park.

### 5. The Eternal Return
History cycles. Names change but patterns repeat.

## Notable Passages

### The Opening (p. 3)
> "riverrun, past Eve and Adam's, from swerve of shore to bend of bay, brings us by a commodius vicus of recirculation back to Howth Castle and Environs."

### The Thunderword (p. 3)
The hundred-letter thunder announcing the Fall.

### "Sir Tristram" (p. 3)
> "Sir Tristram, violer d'amores, fr'over the short sea, had passencore rearrived..."

Introduces the Tristan and Isolde theme.

### Finnegan's Wake (pp. 6–7)
> "Hohohoho, Mister Finn, you're going to be Mister Finnagain!"

The pun on "Finn again" encapsulates the book's theme.

## Characters in This Chapter

| Character | Appears As | Role |
|-----------|------------|------|
| Tim Finnegan | Himself | The original fallen man |
| HCE | Emerging | Takes over from Finnegan |
| ALP | Implied | The river flowing through |
| Mutt and Jute | Themselves | Ancient Irishman meets invader |

### Mutt and Jute (pp. 16–18)
A dialogue between a native Irishman (Mutt) and a foreign invader (Jute), prefiguring the Shem/Shaun conflict. Their miscommunication parodies historical encounters.

## The Chapter as Overture

Campbell and Robinson describe this chapter as "a succession of voices and stories, stitched together with sort of abrupt jump-cuts." Like a musical overture, it:

- Introduces major themes
- Establishes the tone
- Presents characters who will develop later
- Creates patterns that will repeat
