## Key Themes

### 1. The Aging Witness
The Four Old Men were once protagonists themselves. Now they can only watch as younger figures enact the eternal story.

### 2. Oedipal Triangle
Tristan cuckolding King Mark (an HCE figure) represents:
- Son displacing father
- New generation replacing old
- The eternal cycle continuing

### 3. Tristan and Isolde
The medieval romance provides the mythic framework. Tristan (nephew/son) steals Mark's bride—the oedipal betrayal.

### 4. The Ship
The lovers on a ship sailing away—the old men (Mark/HCE) left behind.

## The Eternal Story Continues

Campbell and Robinson:
> "They themselves, in younger days, were protagonists of the great life-roles which they can now only regard and review. Life once stirred in them and shaped them; but it has moved on, so that they now are but cast-off shells."

The old men are what HCE will become—observers of the next generation's passion.
