## Synopsis

### Jaun Meets the Girls (pp. 429–431)
Jaun rests along the road and encounters the 29 girls from St. Bride's School.

### The Sermon Begins (pp. 431–446)
Jaun delivers a moralizing sermon that becomes increasingly sexually suggestive. He singles out Issy for particular attention, mixing religious instruction with barely suppressed desire.

### The Courtship (pp. 446–457)
Jaun courts Issy, boasting of his business prospects and promising her gifts.

### Issy's Reply (pp. 457–461)
Issy responds with an amorous letter.

### Introduction to Dave (pp. 461–468)
Jaun introduces Issy to his brother "Dave" (Shem).

### Departure (pp. 468–473)
Jaun takes his leave; the girls bid farewell to "Haun"—Jaun's ghost.

## The Sermon's Nature

Jaun's sermon parodies:
- Catholic moral instruction
- Irish nationalist ideology
- Patriarchal "protection" of women
- Sexual hypocrisy

His warnings against sin are themselves saturated with sadistic and incestuous desire.

---

## Key Themes

### 1. Religious Hypocrisy
Joyce attacks the "increasingly visible, organised, and powerful brand of Catholicism" of the Free State through Shaun/Jaun's pious posturing.

### 2. Incestuous Desire
Jaun preaches to his sister while clearly desiring her—brother-sister dynamics layered over priest-penitent.

### 3. Sadism and Control
Jaun's "protection" of Issy involves fantasies of violence and domination.

### 4. Regression Continues
Shaun → Jaun → (soon) Yawn → (finally) baby. He regresses through the book.

---

## Notable Passages

### The Sermon Proper (pp. 432–445)
Jaun warns against sin while fantasizing about it.

### The Sadistic Passage (pp. 444–445)
Jaun imagines "riding" Issy like a horse at a rodeo.

### Issy's Letter (pp. 457–461)
Her response to her brother/suitor.

### The Departure (pp. 468–473)
"Haun" as ghost departing.

## Issy's Response

Issy's letter challenges the patriarchal control Jaun asserts. Her "unbridled sexuality" disrupts Free State constructions of ideal Irish femininity.

## Reading Tips

1. **Hear the parody** — The pious voice is meant to be ridiculous
2. **Note the desire** — Religious language masks sexual intent
3. **Watch for "Dave"** — Shem enters at the end
4. **Track the regression** — Shaun → Jaun → next: Yawn
