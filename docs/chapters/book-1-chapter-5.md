## Synopsis

### The Invocation (p. 104)
The chapter opens with a feminized Lord's Prayer: "In the name of Annah the Allmaziful, the Everliving, the Bringer of Plurabilities..."

### The Many Titles (pp. 104–107)
A four-page catalog lists the names by which ALP's "mamafesta" has been known—dozens of alternative titles.

### The Envelope and Handwriting (pp. 107–112)
Scholarly analysis of the physical document: its envelope, the handwriting, the tea stains.

### Methods of Interpretation (pp. 112–119)
Various approaches to reading the letter are discussed—all applicable to the Wake itself.

### The Question of Authorship (pp. 119–125)
Who wrote the letter? The text suggests "not an individual but an entire bloodline of authors."

## The Mamafesta

ALP's letter is her defense of HCE—but also possibly:
- The Wake itself
- The Book of Kells
- Any sacred or literary text
- Human language itself

The letter is described as "a proteiform graph... a polyhedron of scripture" (107).

## Key Themes

### 1. Self-Referentiality
The chapter is Joyce's commentary on how to read his own book, disguised as analysis of a fictional letter.

### 2. The Multiplicity of Meaning
The "polyhedron of scripture" has many faces. No single reading exhausts it.

### 3. Authorship
The letter has no single author—"a multiplicity of personalities inflicted on the documents." Each generation adds to it.

### 4. The Book of Kells
The intricate medieval manuscript serves as model for both the letter and the Wake.

### 5. Chaosmos
The portmanteau "chaosmos" (chaos + cosmos) first appears here—order within disorder.

---

## Notable Passages

### The Opening Invocation (p. 104)
The feminized prayer to "Annah the Allmaziful."

### Polyhedron of Scripture (p. 107)
The letter as three-dimensional text with multiple meanings.

### Chaosmos (p. 118)
Joyce's famous portmanteau: ordered chaos, cosmic chaos.

## Academic Parody

The chapter parodies:
- Biblical exegesis
- Manuscript studies
- The Book of Kells scholarship
- Literary criticism itself

Joyce anticipates (and mocks) the very scholarship that would later surround the Wake.

## The Chapter as Reading Guide

Tips Joyce embeds for reading the Wake:

1. Accept multiple meanings
2. Don't seek a single author or intent
3. See the whole in every part
4. Read as "polyhedron"—three-dimensionally
5. Find order within chaos (chaosmos)

4. **Look for chaosmos** — Order emerges from apparent chaos
