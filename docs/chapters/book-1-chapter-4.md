HCE dreams of burial in Lough Neagh, with a battle interlude.

Another version of the HCE/Cad meeting plays out.

### Festy King's Trial (pp. 85–93)
HCE appears as "Festy King" and is tried for his Park indiscretion. Witnesses offer contradictory testimony. The identity confusion between "Festy King" and "Pegger Festy" makes conviction impossible.

### The Four Judges (pp. 94–96)

## Festy King as HCE

"Festy King" is one of HCE's many incarnations. The name suggests:
- **Feast** — The wake celebration
- **Feis** — Irish festival
- **King** — HCE as ruler/patriarch

The confusion between Festy King and Pegger Festy reflects the split between Shem and Shaun, the twin brothers who embody different aspects of HCE.

## Key Themes

### 1. The Impossible Trial
No conviction is possible because no one can distinguish accusers from accused, witnesses from defendants. Dream logic prevails.

### 2. The Letter
ALP wrote a letter defending HCE, but it never reaches its destination. The letter—possibly the Wake itself—is analyzed but never fully delivered.

### 3. Identity Confusion
Is Festy King the same as Pegger Festy? Is the "Wet Pinter" a third figure? The three soldiers in Phoenix Park multiply and merge.

### 4. The Four Old Men as Judges
Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John preside over the proceedings, representing:
- The Evangelists
- The Four Provinces
- Ancient witnesses
- Remnants of HCE himself

## Notable Passages

### Festy King Introduced (p. 85)
> "a child of Maam, Festy King, of a family long and honourably associated with the tar and feather industries"

### The Cross-Examination (pp. 86–90)
Witnesses offer contradictory accounts; the trial devolves into confusion.

### ALP's Appearance (pp. 101–103)
Anna Livia arrives to defend her husband.

## The Dream Trial

The trial operates by dream logic:
- Identities shift and merge
- Time is non-linear
- Guilt precedes any specific charge
- Exoneration is impossible

This anticipates the longer inquest in III.3.
