## Synopsis

### The Narrator (pp. 403–405)
A first-person narrator—revealed to be the ass that follows the Four Old Men—introduces Shaun.

### Shaun's Introduction (pp. 405–414)
Shaun appears floating down the Liffey in an empty beer barrel, delivering ALP's letter. He holds forth in dialogue with "the people."

### The Ondt and the Gracehoper (pp. 414–419)
Shaun tells a fable—his version of Aesop's Ant and Grasshopper—casting himself as the industrious Ondt and Shem as the frivolous Gracehoper.

### Shaun's Departure (pp. 419–428)
When asked about his brother Shem, Shaun loses his nerve and floats away.

## Shaun as Populist

Shaun represents:
- The **postman** — Can only deliver what others write
- The **politician** — Conservative, nationalist, popular
- **De Valera** — Joyce's satire of Irish nationalism
- The **extrovert** — Social, orthodox, bourgeois

---

## The Ondt and the Gracehoper

Shaun's self-serving fable inverts the usual moral:

| Figure | Represents | Trait |
|--------|------------|-------|
| Ondt | Shaun | Industrious, respectable, cold |
| Gracehoper | Shem | Artistic, frivolous, warm |

But the fable's ending is ambiguous—the Gracehoper sings a song that suggests the artist's freedom may be preferable to the businessman's security.

## Key Themes

### 1. "Shaunishness"
This book embodies what Joyce calls "Shaunishness"—conservative norms so ingrained they seem natural, "just how things are."

### 2. The Post vs. The Penman
Shaun can only deliver; Shem can create. Shaun resents his dependence on his brother's creativity.

### 3. The Empty Barrel
Shaun floats in an empty beer barrel—all container, no content.

### 4. Regression
Throughout Book III, Shaun regresses from old man to overgrown baby.

## Notable Passages

### The Ass as Narrator (p. 405)
"But I, poor ass, am but as their fourpart tinkler's dunkey"

### Shaun in the Barrel (pp. 405–406)
The iconic image of Shaun floating/preaching.

### The Gracehoper's Song (pp. 418–419)
The grasshopper's response to the ant.

## Reading Tips

1. **Note the narrator** — It's the ass!
2. **Read the fable carefully** — It's one of the clearest sections
3. **Watch Shaun's confidence waver** — He can't talk about Shem
4. **Feel the satire** — Joyce is mocking nationalist politics
