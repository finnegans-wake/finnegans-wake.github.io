## Synopsis

### Yawn Discovered (pp. 474–477)
Shaun, now reduced to "Yawn," lies sprawled on a ridge. The Four Old Men and their Ass arrive to hold an inquest.

### The Interrogation (pp. 477–520)
The old men question Yawn ruthlessly. Voices from deeper levels break through—subliminal voices, historical figures, ALP herself.

### The Séance (pp. 520–532)
The inquest becomes a séance. Yawn is a vessel through which HCE speaks.

### HCE's Self-Defense (pp. 532–554)
HCE emerges and delivers "Haveth Childers Everywhere"—his boastful account of the city he founded and his conquest of ALP.

## Yawn's Disintegration

The progression through Book III:
- **Shaun** (III.1) — Confident postman
- **Jaun** (III.2) — Preaching suitor
- **Yawn** (III.3) — Prostrate, disintegrating
- → Ultimately revealed as vessel for HCE

---

## Key Themes

### 1. Return of the Father
HCE, suppressed through Shaun's reign, re-emerges. The son cannot permanently replace the father.

### 2. The Trial That Never Ends
Like the trial in I.4, this inquest produces no verdict. Dream-logic prevails.

### 3. Haveth Childers Everywhere
HCE's boast: "Here Comes Everybody" has built the city, conquered the woman, fathered all children.

### 4. Voices from the Past
Through Yawn, voices emerge from "deeper and deeper stratifications"—the collective unconscious speaking.
