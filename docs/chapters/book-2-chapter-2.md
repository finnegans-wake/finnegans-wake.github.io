# II.2: Night Lessons (pp. 260–308)

The second chapter of Book II is a virtuoso experiment in form: the children do their homework, with Shem's notes in the left margin, Shaun's notes in the right, and Issy's footnotes at the bottom.

## Quick Reference

| Detail | Information |
|--------|-------------|
| Pages | 260–308 |
| Vico Age | Aristocratic (Age of Heroes) |
| Time | Night (homework time) |
| Setting | Upstairs in the pub |
| Main Characters | Dolph (Shem), Kev (Shaun), Issy |

## Synopsis

### The Homework (pp. 260–287)
The children—Dolph (Shem) and Kev (Shaun)—study various subjects: mathematics, geometry, grammar, history, letter-writing.

### The Marginalia
- **Left margin**: Shem's smart-aleck comments
- **Right margin**: Shaun's pompous professorial notes
- **Footnotes**: Issy's irrelevant chitchat and observations

### The Geometry Lesson (pp. 287–304)
Dolph teaches Kev Euclid, specifically how to draw ALP's genitals geometrically. Kev is scandalized and hits Dolph.

### The Historical Names (pp. 305–308)
The margins fill with historically significant names—Cato, Nero, Aristotle, Caesar—as the chapter concludes.

## The Unique Layout

This chapter mimics a schoolbook with marginalia:
- The central text is the "official" lesson
- The margins contain the children's notes
- The footnotes are Issy's commentary

At the midpoint ("half time"), Shem and Shaun switch sides—what was left-margin becomes right.

---

## Key Themes

### 1. Education as Conditioning
Irish schoolbooks were "instruments of cultural conditioning"—shaping religious and political identity.

### 2. The Body in the Text
The geometry lesson explicitly draws ALP's body. Knowledge of the mother becomes knowledge of sex.

### 3. Shem vs. Shaun in Academia
- **Shem/Dolph**: The subversive student, writing smart-aleck notes
- **Shaun/Kev**: The pompous orthodox student, scandalized by knowledge

### 4. Issy's Voice
The footnotes give Issy her own textual space—often irrelevant, sometimes insightful.

---

## Notable Passages

### The Geometry Diagram (pp. 293–294)
A diagram showing how to construct ALP's delta (pubic triangle).

### Kev Strikes Dolph (p. 303)
Shaun hits Shem for the obscene lesson.

### The Final Footnote (p. 307)
"I've lost the place, where was I?"

### The List of Names (p. 306)
"Cato. Nero. Saul. Aristotle. Julius Caesar..."

## Reading Tips

1. **Read the center first** — Then read the margins
2. **Don't skip footnotes** — Issy's voice matters
3. **Watch for the switch** — Shem and Shaun change sides at "half time"
4. **Follow the geometry** — The diagram is meant to be understood
