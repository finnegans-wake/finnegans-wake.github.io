## Synopsis

### The Quiz Format (pp. 126–139)
Twelve questions are posed, each describing a character in riddling fashion. The questions are comically badly written—some are 13 pages long with one-line answers.

### Question 11: The Mookse and the Gripes (pp. 152–159)
Shaun tells the fable of the Mookse (himself) and the Gripes (Shem)—a reworking of the Aesop fable that becomes a parable about religious schism and brotherly conflict.

### The Remaining Questions (pp. 159–168)
The quiz continues with riddles about the remaining characters.

## The Mookse and the Gripes

This fable is one of the most famous sections of the Wake:

### The Setup
The Mookse (Shaun/Pope Adrian IV) encounters the Gripes (Shem/St. Lawrence O'Toole) by a river.

### The Conflict
They represent:
- **Mookse**: Authority, orthodoxy, extroversion, conquest
- **Gripes**: Resistance, heresy, introversion, Ireland

The Mookse supports the English conquest of Ireland; the Gripes represents Irish resistance.

### The Outcome
Neither wins. Both are observed by the Nuvoletta (Issy as cloud), who disappears. Time passes; both become irrelevant.

### Religious Schism
The fable also represents:
- Roman vs. Orthodox Christianity
- Papacy vs. Irish church
- Institutional vs. mystical religion

---

## Key Themes

### 1. Brotherly Conflict
Shem vs. Shaun extends through all of history—every pair of opposing brothers.

### 2. Religious Division
The Mookse and Gripes embody Christianity's schisms.

### 3. Knowledge and Identity
The quiz format questions identity itself—who are these people?

### 4. Collideorscape
The answer "A collideorscape!" (collide + kaleidoscope) describes the Wake's method—constant collision and transformation.

## Notable Passages

### The Opening (p. 126)

### Question 9 Answer (p. 143)
"A collideorscape!"—another one-word summary of the Wake.

### The Mookse and Gripes (pp. 152–159)
The complete fable.
