## Synopsis

### The Rumor Machine

What began as an innocent question in Phoenix Park now circulates through Dublin's collective unconscious. Each teller adds, subtracts, or transforms the story.

### Multiple Versions

The chapter presents various accounts of HCE's crime:
- Voyeurism involving two girls
- Exposure or indecent display
- An encounter with soldiers
- Homosexual proposition
- Nothing at all—mere guilty thoughts

### Public Judgment

HCE's reputation collapses under the weight of rumor. He is judged not in court but in the "surreal court of conscience and bad dreams."

---

## The Pattern: Rise, Accusation, Fall

Joyce establishes a pattern that echoes throughout the Wake:

1. **Rise** — HCE is respectable, a publican and family man
2. **Accusation** — The rumor spreads
3. **Fall** — Reputation destroyed
4. **Possible exoneration** — Never quite achieved

This pattern mirrors:
- Adam and Eve
- Parnell
- Christ
- Finn MacCool
- Humpty Dumpty
- Tim Finnegan

---

## Key Themes

### 1. The Social Construction of Reality
What "really happened" becomes irrelevant. The rumor creates the reality. HCE is guilty because Dublin says so.

### 2. The Dream Trial
Both Kafka's *The Trial* and Joyce's Wake "devote themselves to the prosecution of their central characters in the surreal court of conscience and bad dreams." Neither Josef K. nor HCE receives exoneration.

### 3. Original Sin
Like Adam, HCE carries guilt that may precede any actual act. The accusation reveals something already present.

### 4. Ireland and Its Leaders
Every Irish leader faces the mob: Parnell, O'Connell, Wolfe Tone. Ireland destroys its heroes through rumor and shame.

## The Four Old Men

The "Four Old Men" (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John / Matt, Marcus, Luke, Johnny) begin to appear as witnesses and chroniclers. They represent:

- The Four Evangelists
- The Four Provinces of Ireland
- The Four Masters (Irish annalists)
- Ancient remnants of HCE himself

---

## Notable Passages

### The Spreading Rumor (pp. 52–58)
The story passes from mouth to mouth, changing with each telling.

### The Witnesses (pp. 58–65)
Various unreliable witnesses offer contradictory testimony.

### HCE's Character Assassination (pp. 65–74)
His reputation is systematically destroyed.

## Characters in This Chapter

| Character | Appears As | Role |
|-----------|------------|------|
| HCE | Various names | The accused |
| The Four Old Men | Witnesses | Chroniclers of his fall |
| Various Dubliners | Gossips | Spread and transform the rumor |
| The Three Soldiers | Witnesses | May have seen the crime |
| The Two Girls | Objects | May have been involved |

---

## The Wake's Kafkaesque Quality

Like Josef K. in *The Trial*, HCE never knows exactly what he's accused of, never faces his accusers directly, and never achieves vindication. The trial proceeds in dream-logic, where guilt precedes any charge.

## Reading Tips

1. **Don't look for "the truth"** — The point is that truth becomes impossible to recover
2. **Track the transformations** — Notice how each version differs
3. **Watch for the recurring numbers** — 3-2-1 pattern continues
4. **Note the Four Old Men** — They'll become increasingly important
