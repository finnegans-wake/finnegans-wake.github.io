# I.7: Shem the Penman (pp. 169–195)

The seventh chapter is Joyce's satirical self-portrait: Shaun's devastating (and hilarious) attack on his brother Shem, the artist—a "sham" and a "forger" who is also unmistakably James Joyce himself.

## Synopsis

### Shaun's Attack (pp. 169–185)
Shaun delivers a sustained character assassination of his brother Shem: he's weak, cowardly, drunken, self-exiled, and—worst of all—an artist.

### Shem's House (pp. 176–177)
A grotesque description of the house Shem built for himself, made of disgusting materials.

### The Writing Process (pp. 185–186)
Shem makes ink from his own bodily waste and writes on his own skin.

### Justius and Mercius (pp. 187–195)
The chapter shifts to a dialogue between Justius (justice/Shaun) and Mercius (mercy/Shem), ending with ALP's voice breaking through.

## Shem as Joyce

Shem is unmistakably Joyce:

- **"Usylessly unreadle Blue Book of Eccles"** — *Ulysses*, set on Eccles Street
- **Self-exile** — Joyce left Ireland in 1904 and never returned permanently
- **Drinking** — Joyce's famous alcoholism
- **Cowardice** — Joyce avoided WWI and the Easter Rising
- **Poor eyesight** — Joyce's near-blindness

That Joyce paints such a negative self-portrait shows his commitment to including uncomfortable truths.

## Key Themes

### 1. The Artist as Outcast
Shem is reviled by respectable society—and by his own brother.

### 2. The Artist's Materials
The grotesque image of Shem making ink from bodily waste and writing on his own skin captures art's transformation of life into text.

### 3. Shem vs. Shaun
The eternal conflict:
- **Shem**: Introvert, artist, exile, heretic, bohemian
- **Shaun**: Extrovert, postman, patriot, orthodox, bourgeois

### 4. Joyce and Stanislaus
Joyce's brother Stanislaus was critical of his work. The Shem/Shaun conflict draws on their real relationship.
