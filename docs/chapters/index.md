## Reading Approaches

### Linear Reading
Read chapters in order (I.1 → IV). Accept confusion. The cyclical structure means understanding accumulates.

### Modular Reading
Start with the most accessible chapters:
1. **I.8** (Anna Livia Plurabelle) — Most lyrical
2. **I.7** (Shem the Penman) — Most satirical
3. **III.1** (Shaun the Post) — Most straightforward prose
4. **IV** (Dawn) — Most emotionally direct

### Thematic Reading
Follow motifs across chapters:
- **The Fall**: I.1, I.2, I.3, I.4
- **The Letter**: I.5, I.6, III.3
- **The Brothers**: I.6, I.7, II.1, II.2, III.1–3
- **ALP/River**: I.8, IV
