### The Children's Games (pp. 221–246)

## Key Themes

### 1. Children's Games as Cosmic Drama
The children's play rehearses the eternal conflicts—Shem vs. Shaun, the battle for Issy—in game form.

### 2. The Third Generation
Book II focuses on the children's perspective. They are both subjects and narrators.

### 3. Glugg's Failure
Shem/Glugg cannot guess the riddles because:
- Poor eyesight (Joyce's blindness)
- Artistic detachment
- The artist's alienation from the social

### 4. Issy as Prize
The 29 girls (Issy split into 28+1) are the prize for which the brothers compete.
