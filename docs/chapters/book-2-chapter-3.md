## Synopsis

### The Pub Scene (pp. 309–337)
HCE works behind the bar while his customers drink and talk. A radio plays in the background.

### The Norwegian Captain (pp. 311–332)
A radio broadcast tells the tale of Pukkelsen (a Norwegian Captain), Kersse (a tailor), and how HCE met and married ALP.

### Buckley and the Russian General (pp. 337–355)
The broadcast shifts to a pair of radio comedians—Butt and Taff—who tell how "Buckley Shot the Russian General" during the Crimean War.

### HCE's Defense (pp. 355–370)
HCE attempts to defend himself to his customers.

### The Closing (pp. 370–382)
Last call. HCE drinks the dregs of all the glasses and passes out drunk.

## The Radio/Television Device

The chapter prominently features broadcasts:

> "their tolvtubular high fidelity daildialler" (309)

This early "radio-televisual device" brings news and entertainment into the pub, layering broadcast voices over the local conversation.

---

## Key Themes

### 1. Oral vs. Broadcast Culture
The chapter contrasts traditional oral storytelling (HCE telling tales) with the new technology of broadcast media.

### 2. HCE as Publican
We finally see HCE in his role as pub owner—serving drinks, listening to stories, defending himself.

### 3. War and History
"How Buckley Shot the Russian General" reduces the Crimean War to absurd comedy.

### 4. The Fall (Again)
HCE drinking the dregs and passing out is another version of the fall—Tim Finnegan's drunken death.

---

## Notable Stories

### The Norwegian Captain
A tale of how a Norwegian sailor came to Dublin, met a tailor, and married his daughter—an origin story for HCE and ALP.

### Buckley and the Russian General
An Irish soldier (Buckley) sees a Russian general defecating on the battlefield. He can't shoot a man with his pants down. But when the general wipes himself with a piece of turf (Irish soil), Buckley fires.

## Notable Passages

## Reading Tips

1. **This is the longest chapter** — Take breaks
2. **Listen for the broadcasts** — They're distinguished from pub talk
3. **The comedy is intentional** — Buckley and the General is meant to be absurd
4. **Watch HCE fall** — The ending mirrors Finnegan's fall
