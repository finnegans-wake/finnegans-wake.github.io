## Synopsis

### The Encounter

A man identified as HCE (under various names) walks through Phoenix Park. He encounters "a cad with a pipe" who greets him in Irish and asks the time. HCE, burdened by an obscure guilt, misinterprets this innocent question as an accusation.

### HCE's Guilty Response

Instead of simply giving the time, HCE launches into an unprompted, stammering defense of himself—denying crimes the cad has not mentioned. His "hesitency" (a key word in the book) betrays him.

### The Rumors Begin

The cad goes home, muttering HCE's strange words. His wife overhears. She tells her priest. The priest tells others. The rumor spreads through Dublin's "social unconscious."

### The Ballad

A man named Hosty composes a scurrilous ballad about HCE—"The Ballad of Persse O'Reilly"—that cements his disgrace.

---

## The Crime That May Not Have Happened

The nature of HCE's alleged crime is deliberately obscure. Various versions suggest:

- He exposed himself to two girls
- He watched two girls urinating
- He was propositioned by a soldier
- He committed voyeurism at the Magazine Wall
- Nothing happened at all—only guilty thoughts

The recurring motif is **3-2-1**: three soldiers, two girls, one cad/HCE.

---

## "Hesitency"

HCE's stammer is signaled by the word "hesitency"—deliberately misspelled throughout the book. This references the historical forger Richard Pigott, whose misspelling of "hesitancy" exposed his forgery of letters implicating Charles Stewart Parnell in the Phoenix Park murders.

HCE's guilt, like Parnell's alleged guilt, may be manufactured—but the hesitation reveals something.

---

## Key Themes

### 1. Original Sin
Phoenix Park is Eden. HCE's encounter with the cad rehearses Adam's fall. Whether anything happened is less important than the guilt that now attaches to him.

### 2. The Power of Rumor
An innocent question becomes an accusation. A denial becomes a confession. A rumor becomes a ballad. Public perception creates reality.

### 3. The Cad as Double
The cad may be HCE's own alter ego—a future or past version of himself. The encounter "rehearses the same encounter HCE had ages ago."

### 4. Parnell
Ireland's "uncrowned king," destroyed by scandal and rumor, haunts this chapter. HCE is Parnell is every fallen leader.

---

## Notable Passages

### The Meeting (pp. 35–36)
HCE encounters the cad, who "with a quiquiquock... accosted him."

### The Stammering Defense (p. 36)
HCE's unprompted denial reveals his guilt through "hesitency."

### The Ballad of Persse O'Reilly (pp. 44–47)
> "Have you heard of one Humpty Dumpty / How he fell with a roll and a rumble..."

The ballad transforms HCE into a figure of public mockery—"Persse O'Reilly" puns on French *perce-oreille* (earwig), linking to "Earwicker."

---

## The Recurring Numbers

The pattern 3-2-1 appears throughout the Wake:
- **3 soldiers** — Witnesses or accusers
- **2 girls** — Objects of voyeurism or temptation
- **1 cad/HCE** — The accused

This configuration echoes through every version of the scandal.

## Parnell and the Phoenix Park Murders

In 1882, the Chief Secretary for Ireland and his Under-Secretary were murdered in Phoenix Park by Irish nationalist assassins. Parnell was falsely implicated through forged letters—later exposed when forger Richard Pigott misspelled "hesitancy."

Joyce layers this history onto HCE's scandal:
- Phoenix Park as crime scene
- False accusation through rumor
- Destruction of a leader through public shame
- The telling detail of "hesitency"
