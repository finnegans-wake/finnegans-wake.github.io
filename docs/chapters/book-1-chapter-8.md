## Synopsis

### The Washerwomen (pp. 196–213)
Two women wash HCE's dirty laundry on opposite banks of the Liffey. As they work, they gossip about Anna Livia—her life, her marriage to HCE, her gifts to her children, her defense of her husband.

### The Transformation (pp. 213–216)
As darkness falls, the women can no longer hear each other across the widening river. One becomes a tree; the other becomes a stone.

Joyce weaves hundreds of river names into the dialogue. Examples:
- "O tell me all about Anna Livia! I want to hear all about Anna Livia."

## Key Themes

### 1. Water and Time
The river flows eternally, carrying away sin, washing the dirty laundry of the past.

### 2. Gossip as History
The washerwomen transmit ALP's story through gossip—oral tradition as female knowledge.

### 3. Transformation
At dusk, the women become part of the landscape: a tree and a stone. Human dissolves into nature.

### 4. Redemption
ALP's water washes away HCE's guilt. She takes on his sins and redeems him.

Sylvia Beach wrote: "How beautiful the 'Anna Livia' recording is, and how amusing Joyce's rendering of an Irish washerwoman's brogue!"
