### McHugh's Annotations to Finnegans Wake

**The Essential Companion**

Roland McHugh's *Annotations to Finnegans Wake* (1980, revised 2016) is the standard reference. Each page of annotations corresponds to a page of the Viking/Penguin edition.

| Edition | Year | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| First Edition | 1980 | Original publication |
| Second Edition | 1991 | Corrections and additions |
| Third Edition | 2006 | Further corrections |
| Fourth Edition | 2016 | Johns Hopkins, most current |

**Format:** Words and phrases are positioned to align with the Wake text. Brief glosses identify languages, sources, and allusions.

**Example (for page 3):**
```
3.01  riverrun: Vico's ricorso (return)
      Eve and Adam's: church in Dublin
```

**Best For:** Serious readers; those with the matching Wake edition; line-by-line study.

**ISBN:** 978-1421419121 (2016 edition)

- Vico's cyclic theory explained
- Chapter-by-chapter summaries
- Running paraphrase of the text

**Current Edition:** 2013 edition with updates by Edmund L. Epstein adding 60+ years of subsequent scholarship.

## How to Use Annotations Effectively

### The Dual-Book Method
1. Open the Wake to your page
2. Open McHugh (or FWEET) to the corresponding page
3. Read a sentence in the Wake
4. Check annotations for obscure words
5. Continue

### The Three-Pass Method
**Pass 1:** Read without annotations, getting the flow
**Pass 2:** Read with annotations, noting interesting finds
**Pass 3:** Read without annotations, integrating knowledge

### The Audio-Annotation Method
1. Listen to an audio recording
2. Follow along in the text
3. Stop periodically to check annotations
4. Replay passages that become clearer

### Don't Over-Annotate
Not every word needs annotation. McHugh and FWEET identify multilingual puns and allusions, but much of the Wake is comprehensible English. Trust your reading.

## Annotation Philosophy

### Multiple Valid Readings
Joyce built the Wake to support multiple simultaneous interpretations. "Sinse" might mean:
- Since
- Sense
- Sins
- German "Sinn" (meaning)
- All of the above

Annotations suggest possibilities; they don't close meaning.

### The Text is Primary
Annotations serve the text. If an annotation doesn't illuminate your reading, ignore it. Return later—it might click then.

### Build Your Own Annotations
Many readers keep notes:
- Connections between passages
- Personal associations
- Questions for later research
- Meanings discovered through rereading
