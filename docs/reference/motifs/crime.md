# The Crime

At the center of *Finnegans Wake* is a crime—something HCE did (or didn't do) in Phoenix Park. The nature of the crime is never confirmed, but the **3-2-1 pattern** (three soldiers, two girls, one cad) recurs obsessively.

## The Phoenix Park Incident

Something happened in Phoenix Park involving HCE:

### The Location
Phoenix Park is Dublin's great public park:
- Site of the 1882 Phoenix Park murders
- Contains the Magazine Fort
- Near Chapelizod (where HCE's pub is located)
- A place of public and private acts

### What Happened?
The crime is never definitively stated. Versions include:
- HCE exposed himself to two girls
- HCE watched two girls urinating
- HCE was propositioned by a soldier
- HCE did nothing—only had guilty thoughts
- HCE committed a crime we cannot name

---

## The 3-2-1 Pattern

Every version of the crime involves:

| Number | Element | Variations |
|--------|---------|------------|
| **3** | Soldiers/witnesses | Three redcoats; the Three Soldiers |
| **2** | Girls | Two temptresses; Issy doubled |
| **1** | Cad/HCE | The accused; the witness; the perpetrator |

This pattern recurs throughout the book in countless variations.

## The Cad Encounter (I.2)

The crime emerges in chapter I.2:

### The Meeting
A "cad with a pipe" meets HCE and asks the time. HCE's response:
- He stammers
- He over-explains
- He incriminates himself
- He protests too much

### The Spread
- The cad tells his wife
- His wife tells others
- A ballad is composed
- HCE's reputation is destroyed

### The Ballad
"The Ballad of Persse O'Reilly" (pp. 44–47) mocks HCE publicly:
> "Have you heard of one Humpty Dumpty / How he fell with a roll and a rumble..."

---

## Versions of the Crime

### Sexual Exposure
HCE exposed himself:
- To two girls in the park
- They saw/witnessed
- Three soldiers observed
- Scandal resulted

### Voyeurism
HCE watched:
- Two girls urinating
- Behind a bush
- He was caught looking
- The gaze was the crime

### Homosexual Encounter
A soldier propositioned HCE:
- HCE may have responded
- Or may have fled
- The "crime" is desire itself
- Sexual ambiguity pervades

### Nothing Happened
HCE is innocent:
- He only had thoughts
- The accusation is false
- Guilt precedes the act
- Original Sin is the only crime

---

## The Crime as Original Sin

The crime may be **existence itself**:

> "O foenix culprit!" (p. 23)

### Felix Culpa
Augustine's "happy fault" (felix culpa) suggests:
- Sin was necessary for redemption
- The Fall enables the Rise
- Guilt is the human condition

### HCE's Guilt
HCE may be guilty simply because:
- He is human
- He has desire
- He exists in a fallen world
- All fathers fail

---

## The Three Soldiers

The soldiers appear throughout:

### In Phoenix Park
- They witness the crime
- They report it
- They testify against HCE

### As Historical Figures
- The three at the Cross
- Wellington's soldiers at Waterloo
- Any military trio

### As Structural Element
The number 3 recurs:
- Trinity
- Triad
- Past/Present/Future
- Shem/Shaun/Issy

---

## The Two Girls

The girls are Issy doubled:

### In Phoenix Park
- Two young women
- Objects of HCE's gaze
- Witnesses or temptresses

### As Issy
- Issy and her mirror-twin
- The 28 rainbow girls reduced to 2
- The daughter as temptation

### As Mythological Figures
- Two Isoldes (Ireland and Brittany)
- Eve and Lilith
- Any pair of women

---

## The Magazine Wall

A specific location in Phoenix Park:

### The Setting
> "by the Magazine Wall, zinzin, zinzin" (p. 69)

HCE may have:
- Hidden behind it
- Exposed himself near it
- Been observed there

### The Pun
"Magazine" contains:
- Ammunition store
- Publication (scandal spreads)
- Hidden explosive content

---

## The Prankquean Tale (I.1)

An early version of the crime pattern:

### The Story
- The Prankquean visits the Earl
- She steals his children
- He can't answer her riddle
- The pattern repeats three times

### The Elements
- 1 Earl (HCE)
- 1 Prankquean (temptress)
- Multiple repetitions
- Unanswerable guilt

---

## Guilt and Innocence

The Wake never resolves HCE's guilt:

### Evidence of Guilt
- His stammering defense
- His over-explanation
- His persistent anxiety
- The scandal that follows

### Evidence of Innocence
- No clear accusation
- Conflicting versions
- Perhaps only thoughts
- False witness possible

### The Point
The ambiguity is the point:
- We are all guilty
- We are all innocent
- The crime is being human
- The trial never ends

---

## The Trial (I.4)

HCE is tried as "Festy King":

### The Dream Court
- Surreal proceedings
- Incompetent witnesses
- Contradictory evidence
- No verdict

### Kafka's *Trial*
Like Josef K., HCE:
- Is accused of an unspecified crime
- Cannot defend himself
- Is never acquitted
- Remains guilty

---

## Parnell and the Crime

Charles Stewart Parnell's fall echoes HCE's:

### Parnell's "Crime"
- Adultery with Kitty O'Shea
- Exposed by her husband
- Abandoned by the Irish
- Died in disgrace

### The Pattern
- A great man
- A sexual scandal
- Public exposure
- Irreparable fall

---

## Reading the Crime

### Tips
1. **Watch for 3-2-1** — Three of something, two of something, one of something
2. **Note the stammer** — HCE's "hesitency" signals guilt
3. **Accept ambiguity** — The crime is never resolved
4. **Feel the anxiety** — The text is pervaded by guilt

### Key Passages
- **I.2 (pp. 30–47)**: The cad encounter and ballad
- **I.4**: The trial of Festy King
- **III.3 (pp. 532–554)**: HCE's defense
