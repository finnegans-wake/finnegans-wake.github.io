# The Fall

The Fall is the central motif of *Finnegans Wake*—appearing on the first page and echoing throughout. Every fall implies a rise; every death promises resurrection.

## The First Fall

The book opens with a fall:

> "The fall (bababadalgharaghtakamminarronnkonnbronntonner-
> ronntuonnthunntrovarrhounawnskawntoohoohoordenenthur-
> nuk!) of a once wallstrait oldparr..."

This 100-letter thunderword announces the fall of:
- **Tim Finnegan** from his ladder
- **HCE** from respectability
- **Adam** from Eden
- **Humpty Dumpty** from his wall
- **Lucifer** from Heaven
- **All of us** into mortality

## Tim Finnegan's Fall

From the Irish-American ballad "Finnegan's Wake":

> Tim Finnegan lived in Walkin Street,
> A gentleman Irish mighty odd,
> He had a tongue both rich and sweet,
> An' to rise in the world he carried a hod.

Tim is a hod carrier who:
1. Falls from his ladder
2. Is presumed dead
3. Is waked by friends
4. Revives when whiskey splashes on him

This comic resurrection provides the book's basic pattern: **fall → wake → rise**.

---

## HCE's Fall

HCE's fall is social and psychological:

### The Crime
Something happened in Phoenix Park involving:
- Three soldiers (witnesses)
- Two girls (objects)
- One cad (HCE or his accuser)

### The Scandal
- Rumors spread
- A ballad mocks him
- He is tried (in dreams)
- His reputation crumbles

### The Pattern
| Stage | Event |
|-------|-------|
| **Height** | Respected publican |
| **Accusation** | The cad's encounter |
| **Exposure** | The ballad spreads |
| **Trial** | Festy King in court |
| **Fall** | Social death |
| **Possible Rise** | Dawn in Book IV |

## The Fall in History

Joyce layers historical falls onto Finnegan/HCE:

| Figure | Fall |
|--------|------|
| **Adam** | Eating the apple, expelled from Eden |
| **Lucifer** | Pride, cast from Heaven |
| **Parnell** | Adultery scandal, political ruin |
| **Napoleon** | Waterloo, exile |
| **Oscar Wilde** | Trials, imprisonment |
| **Humpty Dumpty** | The wall, irreparable |

---

## The Fall and Original Sin

The Fall is ultimately **Original Sin**:

> "O foenix culprit!" (p. 23)
> (O felix culpa! — O happy fault!)

Augustine's "felix culpa" suggests the Fall was necessary:
- Without sin, no redemption
- Without fall, no rise
- Without death, no resurrection

HCE's guilt may precede any specific act—he is guilty because he is human.

---

## The 32-Foot Fall

The number **32** recurs throughout:

- **32 feet per second squared**: Acceleration of falling bodies
- **1132**: The date of the fall (also 32 reversed)
- **32 counties**: Ireland whole

The physics of falling embeds itself in the text's numerology.

---

## Humpty Dumpty

The nursery rhyme provides a key template:

> Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall,
> Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.
> All the king's horses and all the king's men
> Couldn't put Humpty together again.

HCE is Humpty:
- **Egg-shaped** (humpbacked)
- **On a wall** (precarious height)
- **Fallen** (irreparably?)
- **Fragmented** (into all his avatars)

But unlike Humpty, Finnegan rises again.

---

## Falling Words

The Fall echoes in the Wake's vocabulary:

### Direct References
- Fall, fell, falling
- Tumble, tumpty, dump
- Drop, droop, descent
- Collapse, crash, crumble

### Punned References
- "Wallstrait oldparr" (Wall Street + Old Parr + wall)
- "Foenix culprit" (Phoenix + felix culpa)
- "Humptyhillhead" (Humpty + Howth Head)

### Sound Patterns
The thunderwords themselves are sounds of falling—crashes, rumbles, the noise of collapse.

---

## The Fall and Dublin

HCE's body is Dublin's geography:

| Body Part | Location | Fall Aspect |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| **Head** | Hill of Howth | Height before fall |
| **Body** | The city | The fallen state |
| **Feet** | Phoenix Park | Scene of the crime |

The sleeping giant (Finn/HCE) lies fallen beneath Ireland, waiting to rise.

---

## The Fall as Dream

The entire book may be a **falling dream**:

- We fall asleep
- We dream of falling
- We wake with a start
- The cycle repeats

This connects to:
- The hypnagogic jerk (falling sensation)
- The descent into unconscious
- The night as "little death"

---

## Falls in Each Book

| Book | Primary Fall |
|------|--------------|
| **I** | Finnegan/HCE's initial fall |
| **II** | The children's games (who falls?) |
| **III** | Shaun's progressive collapse |
| **IV** | The final fall into sea/death |

---

## The Rise

Every fall promises resurrection:

> "Finn, again!" (p. 628)

| Fall | Rise |
|------|------|
| Tim Finnegan dies | Whiskey revives him |
| HCE is disgraced | Dawn brings renewal |
| Adam is expelled | Christ redeems |
| Night falls | Morning comes |

The Wake ends where it begins—the fall is also the rise.

3. **Track the numbers** — 32, 1132, 100
