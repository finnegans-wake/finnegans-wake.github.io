# The Letter

The Letter is one of *Finnegans Wake*'s central mysteries—a document written by ALP in defense of HCE, scratched up by a hen from a midden heap, analyzed by scholars, never delivered. It may be the Wake itself.

## The Basic Story

1. **ALP writes** a letter defending her husband HCE
2. **A hen** (Biddy Doran) scratches it up from a garbage heap
3. **Scholars** analyze it endlessly
4. **It never arrives** at its destination
5. **It may be** the book we're reading

---

## The Hen's Discovery

In I.5, a hen scratches up the letter:

> "Lead, kindly fowl!" (p. 112)

The hen is:
- **Biddy Doran**: A named character
- **ALP herself**: In animal form
- **The reader**: Scratching for meaning
- **Joyce**: Recovering the past

The **midden heap** (garbage pile) represents:
- The past buried and forgotten
- History as refuse
- The unconscious
- Dublin's layers of civilization

---

## Chapter I.5: The Mamafesta

Chapter I.5 is devoted to analyzing the letter:

### "The Mamafesta of ALP"
The chapter title puns on:
- **Manifesta**: A public declaration
- **Mama**: Mother
- **Festa**: Festival/celebration

### The Analysis
Scholars examine:
- The envelope and its marks
- The handwriting
- The watermarks
- The content (never fully quoted)
- The meaning (never determined)

### The Parody
Joyce parodies:
- Academic literary criticism
- Biblical scholarship
- Forensic analysis
- His own future critics

---

## What Does the Letter Say?

The letter's content is never fully revealed. Fragments suggest:

### Possible Contents
- A defense of HCE against accusations
- An account of the Phoenix Park incident
- A love letter from wife to husband
- A mother's testament to her children
- The story of Dublin/Ireland

### Key Fragment (p. 111)
> "Dear. And we go on to Drury... Of Doublganger... Sternly repub..."

The letter is always interrupted, fragmentary, uncertain.

## The Letter as the Wake

The letter may be *Finnegans Wake* itself:

| Letter | Wake |
|--------|------|
| Written by a woman | ALP's voice dominates |
| Defends a fallen man | HCE throughout |
| Found in garbage | Recovered from obscurity |
| Analyzed endlessly | Scholarship industry |
| Never fully understood | Perpetually mysterious |
| Circular | Begins where it ends |

### Evidence
> "a proteiform graph... a polyhedron of scripture" (p. 107)

This describes both the letter and the Wake.

---

## The Letter Never Arrives

A crucial aspect: the letter **never reaches its destination**:

- It is found, not delivered
- It is analyzed, not read
- It is discussed, not understood
- It is everywhere and nowhere

This connects to:
- Lacan's "The Purloined Letter" (letters always arrive)
- Derrida's "The Post Card" (letters never arrive)
- The impossibility of full communication

---

## Who Wrote It?

### ALP as Author
The letter is attributed to ALP:
- She defends her husband
- She speaks for the family
- She writes in "feminine" style

### Shem as Scribe
But Shem may have written it:
- He is "the Penman"
- He writes on his own body (I.7)
- He transcribes ALP's words

### The Collaboration
Perhaps:
- ALP dictates
- Shem writes
- The letter is their joint creation
- Like Joyce and Nora?

---

## The Envelope

The letter's envelope receives detailed attention:

### Marks and Stains
- Tea stains
- Lipstick marks
- Mysterious symbols
- Signs of handling

### The Address
> "To the Doublend Deed..."

The address is unclear, suggesting:
- Dublin/Double
- The dead/deed
- Duplicity
- The reader

---

## Letter and Litter

Joyce puns constantly on **letter/litter**:

- The letter is found in litter (garbage)
- Letters (alphabet) form litter (text)
- Literature comes from litter
- The sacred emerges from refuse

> "The letter! The litter!" (p. 93)

---

## The Letter Through the Book

The letter appears throughout:

| Chapter | Appearance |
|---------|------------|
| I.5 | Main analysis |
| I.1 | First hints |
| II.2 | In the margins |
| III.3 | Through Yawn |
| IV | ALP's final word |

It is never absent, never complete.

---

## Scholarly Parody

Joyce anticipates his critics:

### Academic Analysis
The Wake parodies:
- Source hunting
- Biographical criticism
- Textual scholarship
- Interpretive confidence

### The Joke
Scholars analyzing the letter in I.5 are **us**—future readers trying to decode the Wake.

---

## The Letter and Communication

The letter raises questions about communication:

### Can Meaning Be Transmitted?
- The letter has meaning
- It is written to be read
- But it never arrives
- Is communication possible?

### The Postal Principle
- Writing requires absence
- The sender and receiver are separated
- Meaning drifts in transit
- The letter is always "post"

---

## Reading the Letter

### Tips
1. **Watch for postal imagery** — Letters, mail, delivery, stamps
2. **Note the fragments** — Quotations are always partial
3. **See yourself** — You are the scholar in I.5
4. **Accept mystery** — The letter resists full disclosure

### Key Passages
- **I.5 (pp. 104–125)**: The full analysis chapter
- **p. 93**: "The letter! The litter!"
- **p. 111**: The fragment quoted
- **IV**: ALP's final "letter" to HCE
