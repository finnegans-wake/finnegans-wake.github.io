# The Cycle

*Finnegans Wake* is structured around cycles—Giambattista Vico's ages of history, the water cycle, day and night, life and death. History doesn't progress; it recurs.

## Vico's Four Ages

The book's structure is based on **Giambattista Vico's** *Scienza Nuova* (1725):

### The Ages

| Age | Italian | Character | Quality |
|-----|---------|-----------|---------|
| **1. Divine** | *età degli dei* | Gods | Religion, fear of thunder |
| **2. Heroic** | *età degli eroi* | Heroes | Aristocracy, myth |
| **3. Human** | *età degli uomini* | Humans | Democracy, reason |
| **4. Ricorso** | *ricorso* | Chaos | Dissolution, return |

### The Pattern
After the Human Age, civilization collapses into chaos (*ricorso*), then returns to the Divine Age. History is **circular**, not linear.

---

## The Wake's Structure

Joyce maps Vico onto his four books:

| Book | Vico Age | Content |
|------|----------|---------|
| **I** | Divine | The gods/parents; thunder; origin |
| **II** | Heroic | The children's games; battle |
| **III** | Human | Shaun's sermon; democracy |
| **IV** | Ricorso | Dawn; dissolution; return |

### The Chapters

Each book also contains internal Viconian structure:
- Book I: 8 chapters (divine themes)
- Book II: 4 chapters (heroic games)
- Book III: 4 chapters (human decline)
- Book IV: 1 chapter (ricorso, return)

---

## The Thunderwords

Vico believed each age began with **thunder**—primitive humans heard thunder and believed it was god speaking.

Joyce marks each Viconian transition with a **100-letter thunderword**:

| Thunder | Page | Transition |
|---------|------|------------|
| 1 | 3 | The Fall/Divine begins |
| 2 | 23 | — |
| 3 | 44 | — |
| 4 | 90 | — |
| 5 | 113 | — |
| 6 | 257 | — |
| 7 | 314 | — |
| 8 | 332 | — |
| 9 | 414 | — |
| 10 | 424 | Divine returns |

The tenth thunder has **101 letters**—the extra letter signals the cycle's completion and restart.

---

## The Circular Structure

The Wake famously ends mid-sentence:

> "A way a lone a last a loved a long the" (p. 628)

Which continues on page 3:

> "riverrun, past Eve and Adam's, from swerve of shore to bend of bay..."

### The Circle
- The book has no beginning or end
- Reading can start anywhere
- History repeats eternally
- Death leads to birth

### The River
ALP (the Liffey) flows to the sea, evaporates, returns as rain—the water cycle mirrors the historical cycle.

---

## Day and Night

The Wake takes place during **one night**:

| Time | Content |
|------|---------|
| **Evening** | Book I — The fall, the wake |
| **Midnight** | Book II — The children's games |
| **Deep Night** | Book III — Shaun's watches |
| **Dawn** | Book IV — ALP's monologue |

Every night is the same night; every dawn is the same dawn.

---

## The Family Cycle

The Earwicker family enacts the cycle:

### Generations
1. **Parents** (HCE/ALP) — The old order
2. **Children** (Shem/Shaun/Issy) — The new generation
3. **Future** — The children will become parents

### The Pattern
- The father falls
- The sons compete
- One son rises
- He becomes the father
- He falls
- Repeat

---

## Historical Cycles

Joyce embeds historical cycles:

### Irish History
- Celtic → Viking → Norman → English → Republic
- Each conquest is a ricorso
- Each liberation is a new age

### World History
| Cycle | Rise | Fall |
|-------|------|------|
| Rome | Republic | Empire collapses |
| Church | Medieval power | Reformation |
| Empire | British dominion | Independence movements |

---

## The Coincidence of Opposites

Vico's cycle implies **coincidentia oppositorum**:

- Beginning = End
- Birth = Death
- Rise = Fall
- Shem = Shaun (eventually)

At the moment of collapse, the new age begins within the old.

---

## Bruno's Coincidence

Giordano Bruno (another Viconian thinker) proposed that **opposites coincide**:

> "The minimum coincides with the maximum."

In the Wake:
- The oldest is the youngest
- The dead are the living
- The end is the beginning

---

## Reading Cyclically

### Strategies
1. **Don't seek progress** — The story doesn't "go" anywhere
2. **Expect return** — What falls will rise
3. **Notice echoes** — Patterns repeat with variation
4. **Read around** — Start anywhere; return everywhere

### The Experience
Reading the Wake is like living:
- Days repeat
- Seasons cycle
- Generations pass
- Something endures

---

## The Ten Thunderwords

The thunderwords mark transitions:

| Number | Letters | Function |
|--------|---------|----------|
| 1–9 | 100 each | Mark Viconian phases |
| 10 | 101 | Completes the 1001 (Arabian Nights) |

**Total: 1001 letters** — The number of *Arabian Nights*, suggesting infinite storytelling.

---

## Time in the Wake

### Linear Time Rejected
- No clear chronology
- Past and future blend
- "Today" contains all days

### Cyclical Time Embraced
- The same events recur
- Characters transform but patterns persist
- History is "a nightmare from which I am trying to awake" (Ulysses)

### Eternal Recurrence
- Nietzsche's concept
- Every moment returns infinitely
- Accept and affirm

---

## Key Passages

### The Opening/Closing
- **p. 3**: "riverrun..."
- **p. 628**: "the" → "riverrun"

### Vico Explicitly
- **p. 452**: "The Vico road goes round and round to meet where terms begin."

### The Thunder
- **p. 3**: First thunderword
- **p. 424**: Tenth thunderword
