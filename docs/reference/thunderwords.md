# The Ten Thunderwords

*Finnegans Wake* contains ten "thunderwords"—massive portmanteau constructions of approximately one hundred letters each. These words, built from thunder-words in dozens of languages, mark the transitions between ages in Joyce's Viconian structure.

## Overview

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Number | 10 thunderwords |
| Length | First 9 = 100 letters; 10th = 101 letters |
| Total letters | 1,001 (evoking *The Thousand and One Nights*) |
| Function | Mark transitions between Vico's ages |
| Source | Thunder-words from multiple languages |

## Vico and Thunder

According to Giambattista Vico's *La Scienza Nuova* (1725), primitive humans—wandering the forests after the Flood—heard thunder for the first time and believed it was the voice of God. This thunder:

1. Inspired the invention of **religion** (to appease the angry sky-god)
2. Drove humans to seek **shelter** (the first homes)
3. Prompted the creation of **language** (imitating divine speech)

Joyce built ten thunderclaps into the Wake to mark the great transitions of human history and consciousness.

---

## Total: 1,001 Letters

The ten thunderwords together contain exactly **1,001 letters**—evoking *The Book of a Thousand and One Nights* (*Arabian Nights*).

- 9 thunderwords × 100 letters = 900
- 1 thunderword × 101 letters = 101
- **Total = 1,001**

This connects the Wake to the frame narrative of Scheherazade, who tells stories to delay death—just as HCE's dream defers the dawn.

## Eric McLuhan's Interpretation

In *The Role of Thunder in Finnegans Wake* (1997), Eric McLuhan (son of Marshall McLuhan) argues that each thunderword encodes a major **communications revolution**:

| Thunder | Technology/Revolution |
|---------|----------------------|
| 1 | Speech / the Fall into language |
| 2 | Writing / the rise of cities |
| 3 | The ballad / oral tradition |
| 4 | Print / public discourse |
| 5 | Manuscript / scholarship |
| 6 | Mass media beginnings |
| 7 | Radio |
| 8 | War reporting / telegraphy |
| 9 | Television |
| 10 | The electric age complete |

McLuhan presents the Wake as "both an encyclopedia of the effects of technology in reshaping human culture and society, and a complete training course for detecting the changes in sensibility occasioned by new media."

---

## The Dreamer and Thunder

Some scholars argue that thunder is the **only element from the "real world"** that enters HCE's dream:

> "There is a thunderstorm while he is dreaming; when thunder cracks it makes its way into the dream."

The thunderwords would then be the dreamer's mind processing actual thunder into the fabric of the dream-text.

- **[FinnegansWiki Thunderwords](https://www.finnegansweb.com/wiki/index.php/Category:Thunderwords)** — Wiki entries for each

### Tips for Reading Aloud

1. **Sound them out** — They're meant to sound like thunder
2. **Don't rush** — Let each syllable roll
3. **Find the languages** — Hearing "kaminari" or "tonnerre" helps
4. **Accept approximation** — There's no single "correct" pronunciation
