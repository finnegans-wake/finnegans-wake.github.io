# Composition Timeline (1922–1939)

James Joyce devoted seventeen years to writing *Finnegans Wake*—from the completion of *Ulysses* in 1922 to publication on 4 May 1939. During this time, the work was known only as "Work in Progress."

## Overview

| Period | Activity |
|--------|----------|
| 1922 | *Ulysses* published; Joyce exhausted |
| 1923 | First sketches written |
| 1924–1937 | Serialization as "Work in Progress" |
| 1939 | Published as *Finnegans Wake* |
| 1941 | Joyce dies in Zurich |

---

## 1922: After Ulysses

### February 2, 1922
*Ulysses* published by Shakespeare and Company in Paris on Joyce's 40th birthday.

### The Year of Silence
Joyce was so exhausted that he did not write a line of prose for over a year. He later described this period as recovery from the immense effort of completing *Ulysses*.

---

## 1923: The First Sketches

### March 10, 1923
Joyce writes to his patron Harriet Shaw Weaver:

> "Yesterday I wrote two pages—the first I have written since the final Yes of Ulysses."

These two pages deal with **Roderick O'Conor**, the last High King of Ireland. This is the earliest material that would become *Finnegans Wake*.

### July–August 1923 (Bognor)
While holidaying in Bognor, England, Joyce completes four more sketches:

| Sketch | Subject | Final Location |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| Tristan and Isolde | The love legend | II.4 |
| Saint Patrick and the Druid | Irish Christianity | IV |
| Kevin's Orisons | Saint Kevin | IV |
| Mamalujo | The Four Old Men | II.4 |

### August 1923
Joyce writes **"Here Comes Everybody"**—the first sketch dealing with the protagonist HCE.

---

## 1924: First Publication

### April 1924
The **"Mamalujo" sketch** becomes the first fragment published, appearing in *Transatlantic Review* 1.4.

- Editor: Ford Madox Ford
- Title: "From Work in Progress"
- Significance: First public appearance of Joyce's new work
- Length: 8 pages

This was "a term applied to works by Ernest Hemingway and Tristan Tzara published in the same issue."

---

## 1925: Four Sketches Published

| Month | Sketch | Publication |

| October | "Anna Livia Plurabelle" (first draft) | *Le Navire d'Argent* |
| Autumn–Winter | "Shem the Penman" (first draft) | *This Quarter* |

### The Sigla System
Around 1925–1926, Joyce consolidates his **sigla**—the private symbols he uses for the main characters:

- ⌂ = HCE
- Δ = ALP
- ⊏ = Shem
- ⊐ = Shaun
- ⋀ = Issy

---

## 1926: Major Progress

### Completion of Parts I and III
By 1926, Joyce has largely completed drafts of **Parts I and III**—the largest sections of the book.

### Continued Serialization
*Two Worlds* publishes revised versions:
- December 1925: "Here Comes Everybody"
- March 1926: "Anna Livia Plurabelle"
- June 1926: "Shem the Penman"
- September 1926: "Mamalujo"

## 1927: transition Magazine

### Eugene Jolas
Joyce befriends Eugene Jolas, editor of *transition*, an avant-garde literary magazine published in Paris.

### April 1927
*transition* begins serializing the work with **"Opening Pages of a Work in Progress"** (the book's first chapter).

### The transition Years (1927–1938)
*transition* becomes the primary venue for "Work in Progress," publishing fragments regularly over the next decade.

---

## 1928–1929: Anna Livia Plurabelle

### 1928
Joyce intensively revises the **Anna Livia Plurabelle** chapter (I.8), weaving in hundreds of river names from around the world.

### August 1929
Joyce records himself reading from "Anna Livia Plurabelle"—the only recording of Joyce reading from *Finnegans Wake*.

- Location: Cambridge, England
- Arranged by: Sylvia Beach

When asked about the title, Joyce would only say: "It will be called—but I can't tell you."

---

## 1938: Final Revisions

### January–December 1938
Joyce makes final revisions to the complete text, integrating all sections and ensuring the circular structure works.
