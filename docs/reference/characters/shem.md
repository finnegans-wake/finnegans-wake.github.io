# Shem the Penman

Shem is the artistic twin son of HCE and ALP—a writer, exile, and bohemian who is Joyce's satirical self-portrait. He represents introversion, creativity, heresy, and the transformative power of art.

## Quick Reference

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Role | Son, artist, writer, exile |
| Sigil | ⊏ (open to the left—introvert) |
| Twin | Shaun the Postman |
| Key Chapter | I.7 ("Shem the Penman") |
| Key Phrase | "Shem is short for Shemus" |

---

## Names and Manifestations

Shem appears under many names, always in opposition to Shaun:

| As Shem | As Shaun |
|---------|----------|
| Shem | Shaun |
| The Penman | The Post |
| Glugg | Chuff |
| Dolph | Kev |
| The Gracehoper | The Ondt |
| Mercius | Justius |
| Nick | Mick |
| Jerry | Kevin |
| Butt | Taff |

## Shem as Joyce

Shem is unmistakably Joyce himself:

| Shem | Joyce |
|------|-------|
| The "usylessly unreadle Blue Book of Eccles" | *Ulysses* (set on Eccles Street) |
| Self-exile from Ireland | Joyce left Ireland in 1904 |
| Heavy drinking | Joyce's alcoholism |
| Poor eyesight | Joyce's near-blindness |
| Artistic poverty | Joyce's financial struggles |
| Cowardice during war | Joyce avoided WWI/Easter Rising |

That Joyce paints such a **negative self-portrait** shows his commitment to including uncomfortable truths.

## The Penman

Shem is the writer:

> "Shem was a sham and a low sham" (p. 170)

While Shaun can only **deliver** what others write (as the Post), Shem can **create**—he is the Penman. But his creativity is mocked as:

- Forgery
- Shamming
- Transgression
- Exile's delusion

### The Writing Process (pp. 185–186)

In a famous grotesque passage, Shem:
1. Makes ink from his own bodily waste
2. Writes on his own skin
3. Transforms excrement into art

This can be read as:
- Literal grotesquerie (shocking the bourgeois)
- Artistic metaphor (transforming waste into beauty)
- Autobiographical (writing from/about the body)
- Religious (the word made flesh)

---

## Chapter I.7

Chapter I.7 ("Shem the Penman") is Shaun's character assassination of his brother:

### Structure
- Shaun as narrator attacks Shem
- Shem's weaknesses catalogued
- The house Shem built (from disgusting materials)
- The writing process described
- Dialogue between Justius (Shaun) and Mercius (Shem)
- ALP intervenes to defend her son

### Key Passage
> "O, the lowness of him was beneath all up to that sunk to!" (p. 171)

The attack is meant to be both devastating and funny.

## Shem vs. Shaun

The twins represent fundamental oppositions:

| Shem | Shaun |
|------|-------|
| Introvert | Extrovert |
| Artist | Postman |
| Creator | Deliverer |
| Heretic | Orthodox |
| Exile | Patriot |
| Bohemian | Bourgeois |
| Theory | Practice |
| Time | Space |
| Hearing | Sight |
| Tree | Stone |
| Feminine | Masculine |

### Psychological Reading
- **Shem**: The id, base impulses, creativity
- **Shaun**: The superego, social rules, conformity

### Their Conflict
The brothers battle throughout the Wake, often over Issy. Their conflict encapsulates all the battles of history—Cain and Abel, Jacob and Esau, Set and Horus.

---

## Mythological Parallels

| Figure | Role |
|--------|------|
| Cain | The outcast brother |
| Jacob | The trickster twin |
| Set | The dark brother |
| Remus | The brother who loses |
| Satan/Nick | The rebel |

---

## The Ondt and the Gracehoper

In Shaun's fable (III.1, pp. 414–419):

- **The Ondt** (Ant/Shaun): Industrious, respectable, cold
- **The Gracehoper** (Grasshopper/Shem): Artistic, frivolous, warm

The fable inverts Aesop—the Gracehoper's song suggests the artist's freedom may be preferable to the businessman's security.

---

## Shem and His Mother

ALP defends Shem:

- At the end of I.7, her voice breaks through Shaun's attack
- The letter she writes may be in Shem's handwriting
- As the river, she flows through him

Shem is the "artistic" child—closer to the mother, more emotional, more fluid.

---

## Key Passages

### The Opening (I.7, p. 169)
> "Shem is short for Shemus as Jem is joky for Jacob."

### The House (I.7, pp. 176–177)
The grotesque house Shem builds from body waste.

### The Writing (I.7, pp. 185–186)
Making ink from excrement, writing on skin.

### The Gracehoper's Song (III.1, pp. 418–419)
His response to Shaun's prudent Ondt.

---

## Joyce and Stanislaus

The Shem/Shaun conflict reflects Joyce's relationship with his brother **Stanislaus**:

- Stanislaus was more practical, more orthodox
- Stanislaus criticized *Ulysses*
- When he read the first Wake fragments, Stanislaus wrote: "It is unspeakably wearisome"
- Joyce was the exile; Stanislaus stayed

---

## Reading Shem

### Tips
1. **Enjoy the satire** — The attack is meant to be funny
2. **Look for Joyce** — Autobiographical details abound
3. **Note ALP's intervention** — She defends her son
4. **Track the oppositions** — Every Shem appearance implies Shaun
