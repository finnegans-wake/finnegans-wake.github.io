# Shaun the Postman

Shaun is the respectable twin son of HCE and ALP—a postman, politician, and conformist who can deliver but not create. He represents extroversion, orthodoxy, nationalism, and the establishment.

## Quick Reference

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Role | Son, postman, politician, preacher |
| Sigil | ⊐ (open to the right—extrovert) |
| Twin | Shem the Penman |
| Key Chapters | III.1–3 (the Watches of Shaun) |
| Key Phrase | "Shaun the Post" |

---

## Names and Manifestations

Shaun appears under many names, always in opposition to Shem:

| As Shaun | As Shem |
|----------|---------|
| Shaun | Shem |
| The Post | The Penman |
| Chuff | Glugg |
| Kev | Dolph |
| The Ondt | The Gracehoper |
| Justius | Mercius |
| Mick | Nick |
| Kevin | Jerry |
| Taff | Butt |
| Jaun | Dave |
| Yawn | — |

## The Post vs. The Penman

Shaun's defining limitation: he can only **deliver** what others create.

> "While Shem is the Penman, Shaun is the Post—not someone who can wield the pen, but who can only deliver what has been written."

This makes him dependent on his brother, which he resents.

## Book III: The Watches of Shaun

Book III belongs to Shaun, following his progression and regression:

| Chapter | Name | State |
|---------|------|-------|
| III.1 | Shaun | Confident postman in barrel |
| III.2 | Jaun | Preaching suitor |
| III.3 | Yawn | Prostrate, disintegrating |
| — | (Baby) | Final regression |

As Book III progresses, Shaun regresses from old man to baby.

---

## III.1: Shaun the Post

Shaun appears floating down the Liffey in an empty beer barrel:

- **The barrel**: All container, no content
- **The narrator**: An ass (literally, the donkey)
- **The fable**: The Ondt and the Gracehoper
- **The failure**: He can't talk about Shem

When asked about his brother, Shaun loses his nerve and floats away.

---

## III.2: Jaun's Sermon

Shaun (as "Jaunty Jaun") preaches to Issy and 28 schoolmates:

- His sermon mixes religious instruction with sexual desire
- He attacks Shem as a seducer
- He courts his own sister
- His moral posturing masks hypocrisy

This chapter satirizes:
- Irish Catholic piety
- Nationalist politics (De Valera)
- Patriarchal "protection" of women

---

## III.3: Yawn's Inquest

Shaun (now "Yawn") lies prostrate on a hill:

- The Four Old Men interrogate him
- Voices emerge from deeper levels
- He disintegrates
- HCE emerges through him

The chapter reveals that Shaun is merely a vessel—beneath him lies the father (HCE) who speaks the final self-defense.

---

## Shem vs. Shaun

The twins represent fundamental oppositions:

| Shaun | Shem |
|-------|------|
| Extrovert | Introvert |
| Postman | Artist |
| Deliverer | Creator |
| Orthodox | Heretic |
| Patriot | Exile |
| Bourgeois | Bohemian |
| Practice | Theory |
| Space | Time |
| Sight | Hearing |
| Stone | Tree |
| Masculine | Feminine |

### Psychological Reading
- **Shaun**: The superego, social rules, conformity
- **Shem**: The id, base impulses, creativity

---

## "Shaunishness"

Joyce uses the term "Shaunishness" to describe:

> "The insistence upon certain norms in historically unreflective ways... when norms become so inculcated that they cease to look like norms—they become 'just how things are.'"

Book III embodies this conservative worldview—and its collapse.

---

## The Ondt and the Gracehoper

In III.1, Shaun tells this fable casting himself as the industrious Ondt (Ant):

| Figure | Represents | Trait |
|--------|------------|-------|
| **Ondt** | Shaun | Hard-working, cold, respectable |
| **Gracehoper** | Shem | Artistic, warm, frivolous |

But the fable's ambiguity undermines Shaun's message—the Gracehoper's song suggests freedom may be worth more than security.

---

## Mythological Parallels

| Figure | Role |
|--------|------|
| Abel | The favored brother |
| Esau | The conventional twin |
| Horus | The light brother |
| Romulus | The brother who wins |
| Saint Michael/Mick | The angel |

---

## Shaun and Politics

Shaun represents the **conservative nationalism** of the Irish Free State:

- De Valera's politics
- Catholic social teaching
- Bourgeois respectability
- Anti-intellectual conformity

Joyce uses Shaun to satirize the Ireland he had left behind.

---

## Shaun and Issy

Shaun desires his sister Issy:

- In III.2, his sermon to her is sexually charged
- His "protection" masks possession
- He competes with Shem for her affection
- The girls prefer him, but his victory is hollow

---
