## The 28/29 Rainbow Girls

Issy multiplies into groups:

| Number | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **7** | The rainbow colors |
| **28** | Days of February (non-leap year) |
| **29** | Days of February (leap year) |
| **28+1** | Issy plus her doubles |

In II.1, they appear as "THE FLORAS (Girl Scouts from St. Bride's Finishing Establishment)."

In III.2, they are the "rainbow girls" to whom Jaun preaches.

## Issy and Her Brothers

Both Shem and Shaun desire Issy:

### The Competition
- In II.1, Glugg (Shem) fails to guess her riddles
- Chuff (Shaun) is favored by the girls
- The brothers fight over her throughout

### In III.2
Jaun (Shaun) preaches to Issy and her friends—his sermon mixing religious instruction with barely suppressed desire for his own sister.

Her letter (III.2, pp. 457–461) responds with "unbridled sexuality" that challenges patriarchal control.

## Issy and the Tristan Legend

Issy connects to Isolde of the Tristan myth:

| Figure | Role |
|--------|------|
| **Isolde of Ireland** | The young beloved |
| **Isolde of Brittany** | The replacement bride |
| **Issy** | Both Isoldes combined |

The "Iseult la belle" splits into Issy's doubles—the desirable and the available, the young and the aging.

## The Footnotes (II.2)

In the "Night Lessons" chapter (II.2), Issy provides the **footnotes**:

- While Shem and Shaun argue in the margins
- Issy comments from below
- Her voice is often irrelevant, sometimes insightful
- She represents the feminine perspective excluded from the main text

This chapter was published separately as *Storiella as She is Syung*, emphasizing her role.

## Issy and Lucia Joyce

Scholars note parallels between Issy and Joyce's daughter **Lucia**:

- Lucia suffered from mental illness (schizophrenia)

| **Persephone** | The daughter stolen to underworld |
| **The Rainbow** | Bridge between worlds |
| **Iris** | Rainbow goddess, messenger |

- The letter "A" inverted (ALP's daughter)
- A tent or shelter

- HCE's crime involves watching/exposing himself to two girls
- These girls are Issy in two forms
- The father's desire for the daughter
- The oedipal/incestuous dimension

---

## Key Passages

### The Footnotes (II.2, pp. 260–308)
Her voice from below the text.

### Her Letter (III.2, pp. 457–461)
Her response to Jaun's sermon.

## The Rainbow Connection

HCE wears **seven articles of clothing** at key moments—corresponding to:
- The seven rainbow colors
- Issy as the seven rainbow girls
- Nature (Issy) clothing the archetype (HCE)

The rainbow connects earth and sky, mortal and divine—like Issy connecting the parents to the future.
