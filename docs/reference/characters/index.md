| Matt Gregory | Matthew | Ulster | Historian |
| Marcus Lyons | Mark | Munster | Judge |

They appear throughout as witnesses, judges, and chroniclers—older versions of HCE watching younger versions enact the eternal story.

### The Twelve

Twelve jurors/apostles/customers who appear in crowd scenes, particularly during trials and pub scenes.

### Kate

The cleaning woman who tends the midden heap where the letter is found. She connects past to present through memory.

## The Sigla System

Joyce developed private symbols for the characters around 1925–1926:

| Symbol | Character | Meaning |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| ⌂ | HCE | House/Mountain |
| Δ | ALP | Delta/Triangle/River mouth |
| ⊏ | Shem | Open to the left (introvert) |
| ⊐ | Shaun | Open to the right (extrovert) |
| ⋀ | Issy | Divided/Mirror |

These sigla appear in Joyce's notebooks and drafts, helping him track characters across their many manifestations.

## Patterns of Appearance

### The 3-2-1 Pattern

A recurring configuration throughout the Wake:
- **3** soldiers/witnesses
- **2** girls/temptresses
- **1** man/cad/HCE

This pattern appears in every retelling of HCE's crime.

### The Numbers

| Number | Represents |

## Reading Characters

### Tips

1. **Watch for initials**: H-C-E or A-L-P patterns signal character presence
2. **Note transformations**: The same character may shift identity mid-sentence
3. **Accept multiplicity**: Characters are simultaneously themselves and their archetypes
4. **Track relationships**: Family dynamics persist even when names change

### Example

> "Howth Castle and Environs" (p. 3)

This is simultaneously:
- A place name (Howth Castle)
- HCE's initials
- The beginning of HCE's presence in the text
