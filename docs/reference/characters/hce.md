---

## The Name's Origin

In chapter I.2, HCE receives his nickname "Earwicker" when the Sailor King encounters him at a tollgate. HCE is attempting to catch earwigs with an inverted flowerpot on a stick.

The name also connects to:
- **Earwig** (*perce-oreille* in French, punned as "Persse O'Reilly")
- **Hugh Childers** (1827–96), a portly politician nicknamed "Here Comes Everybody"
- **Ear** (hearing/eavesdropping) + **wicker** (basket/gate)

---

## Physical Description

Joyce provides little direct physical description, but we know:

- **Humpbacked** — Suggested by his initials and the Humpty Dumpty association
- **Stammering** — His "hesitency" reveals his guilt
- **Foreign** — Of Scandinavian descent
- **Middle-aged** — A settled family man

His body becomes the landscape of Dublin itself—head at Howth, feet at Phoenix Park.

---

## The Crime

HCE's defining characteristic is his mysterious guilt over an incident in Phoenix Park. The nature of the crime is never definitively stated:

### Possible Versions
- Exposed himself to two girls
- Watched two girls urinating
- Was propositioned by a soldier
- Committed voyeurism at the Magazine Wall
- Did nothing—only had guilty thoughts

### The Pattern (3-2-1)
Every version involves:
- **3** soldiers/witnesses
- **2** girls
- **1** cad/HCE

### The Real Crime
The crime may be **Original Sin** itself—the guilt that precedes any specific act. HCE is guilty because he is human.

---

## HCE and Dublin

HCE is identified with the city of Dublin:

> "His clay feet... at Phoenix Park... while his head lies under the Hill of Howth."

As the sleeping giant beneath Dublin:
- **Head**: Hill of Howth
- **Body**: The city
- **Feet**: Chapelizod/Phoenix Park

This connects him to Finn MacCool, who according to legend lies sleeping beneath Ireland, waiting to rise again.

---

## The Fall

HCE experiences multiple "falls":

| Fall | Parallel |
|------|----------|
| The Phoenix Park incident | Original Sin |
| Social disgrace | Parnell's fall |
| Getting drunk in the pub | Tim Finnegan |
| Dream-death | Every night's sleep |

The pattern is always: **rise → accusation → fall → (possible) resurrection**

---

## The Trial

HCE is tried throughout the book:

- **I.4**: As Festy King in dream-court
- **III.3**: Through his son Yawn, as voices emerge from the past
- **Throughout**: In the court of public opinion

He is never acquitted. Like Josef K. in Kafka's *The Trial*, HCE remains guilty of an unspecified crime.

---

## "Haveth Childers Everywhere"

In III.3 (pp. 532–554), HCE delivers his great self-defense, boasting:

- He built the city of Dublin
- He conquered Anna Livia (ALP)
- He fathered children everywhere
- He is the source of civilization

This section was published separately in 1930 by Faber & Faber.

---

## The Dreamer

The entire Wake may be HCE's dream:

- The book takes place during one night
- HCE lies sleeping above his pub
- All events are filtered through his dreaming consciousness
- The initials H-C-E structure reality

### Evidence
- The book begins and ends with the same sentence (dream circularity)
- Events blend past, present, and future (dream logic)
- Characters transform (dream fluidity)
- Guilt pervades everything (dream anxiety)

---

## HCE and the Family

### As Husband
HCE's relationship with ALP combines:
- Tender affection
- Sexual guilt
- Mutual dependence
- Historical partnership (they built Dublin together)

### As Father
His sons represent split aspects of himself:
- **Shaun**: The social, respectable self
- **Shem**: The artistic, guilty self

His daughter Issy represents:
- The temptation that led to his fall
- The young ALP
- The next generation

## Mythological Parallels

| Figure | Connection |
|--------|------------|
| **Finn MacCool** | Sleeping giant under Ireland |
| **Adam** | First man, first fall |
| **Osiris** | Murdered god who rises |
| **King Mark** | Cuckold in Tristan legend |
| **Humpty Dumpty** | Great fall, impossible reassembly |
| **Noah** | Drunk patriarch, flood survivor |

## Reading HCE

### Tips
1. **Watch for H-C-E patterns** — They appear in words, initials, phrases
2. **Note the stammer** — "Hesitency" signals HCE's presence
3. **Accept transformation** — He changes names constantly
4. **Feel the guilt** — His anxiety pervades the text

### Example
> "that sword of certainty which would indentifide the body never" (p. 51)

Contains: "H" (that), "C" (certainty), "E" (identity/never) — HCE is present.
