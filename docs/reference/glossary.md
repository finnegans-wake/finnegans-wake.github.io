**Anna Livia Plurabelle.** The mother figure, HCE's wife, the River Liffey. Sigla: ∆

### Anna Livia Plurabelle
The chapter (I.8, pp. 196-216) featuring two washerwomen discussing ALP. Also the character herself. Joyce recorded this section in 1929.

---

## F

### FWEET
**Finnegans Wake Extensible Elucidation Treasury.** Online database of 101,670+ annotations at [fweet.org](http://fweet.org).

### Fall
The central event of the Wake. HCE's transgression in Phoenix Park, echoing Adam's fall, Humpty Dumpty's fall, Tim Finnegan's fall, and all human failure.

### Finn MacCool
Irish mythological giant who sleeps under Dublin, awaiting resurrection. HCE as Finn = "Finnegan" = "Finn again."

---

## G

### Genetic Criticism
Study of a work's composition through drafts and manuscripts. The James Joyce Digital Archive enables genetic study of the Wake.

---

## H

### HCE
**Humphrey Chimpden Earwicker.** The father figure, Dublin publican, dreamer. Also "Here Comes Everybody," "Howth Castle and Environs," etc. Sigla: ⊓

### Howth
Promontory north of Dublin. "Howth Castle and Environs" is one expansion of HCE. The Wake's final sentence returns "to Howth Castle and Environs."

---

## I

### Issy
**Isolde.** The daughter figure, often doubled with her mirror image. Object of inappropriate desire. Sigla: ⊣

---

## J

### JJDA
**James Joyce Digital Archive** at [jjda.ie](https://jjda.ie). Presents the complete compositional history of *Ulysses* and *Finnegans Wake*.

---

## L

### Letter
A letter written by ALP defending HCE, found in a rubbish heap by a hen. Analyzed in I.5. The letter may be the Wake itself.

### Liffey
Dublin's river. Anna Livia is the Liffey personified. The name contains "Livia" (ALP) and sounds like "life."

---

## M

### Mamalujo
The four old men (Matt Gregory, Marcus Lyons, Luke Tarpey, Johnny MacDougall), representing the four evangelists. The name comes from their initials: M.M.L.J.

### McHugh
Roland McHugh, author of *Annotations to Finnegans Wake* (1980/2016), the standard reference.

---

## P

### Phoenix Park
Large park in Dublin where HCE's crime allegedly occurred. "Phoenix" suggests resurrection; the park contains many Wake locations.

### Portmanteau
A word combining two or more words, like "chaosmos" (chaos + cosmos). Lewis Carroll coined the term; Joyce perfected the technique.

---

## R

### Ricorso
Vico's term for the "return" phase of historical cycles—chaos leading back to a new theocratic age. Book IV represents the ricorso.

### Riverrun
The Wake's famous first word, combining "river run" with Vico's "ricorso" (return). The book's final incomplete sentence ("A way a lone a last a loved a long the") flows into "riverrun."

---

## S

### Shaun
**Shaun the Post.** The extrovert twin, postman, man of action. Opposite of Shem. Also appears as Jaun, Yawn, Juan. Sigla: ⌐ (reversed)

### Shem
**Shem the Penman.** The introvert twin, artist, Joyce's self-portrait. Opposite of Shaun. Also appears as Jerry, Glugg, Dolph. Sigla: ⌐

### Sigla
Symbols Joyce used to represent characters in his notebooks:
- ⊓ = HCE
- ∆ = ALP
- ⌐ = Shem (reversed for Shaun)
- ⊣ = Issy
- X = The Four

### Skeleton Key
Joseph Campbell and Henry Morton Robinson's *A Skeleton Key to Finnegans Wake* (1944), the first comprehensive guide.

---

## T

### Thunderwords
Ten 100-letter words scattered through the Wake, representing Vico's thunder that initiated each historical cycle. The ten total 1001 letters.

### Tristan and Isolde
Medieval romance that pervades the Wake. HCE = King Mark; Shem/Shaun = Tristan; Issy = Isolde.

---

## U

### Ulysses
Joyce's previous novel (1922). The Wake continues and transforms many Ulysses themes and techniques. Leopold Bloom occasionally surfaces in HCE.

---

## V

### Vico, Giambattista
Italian philosopher (1668-1744) whose *New Science* proposed cyclical history: theocratic → aristocratic → democratic → ricorso (return). Joyce structured the Wake on this pattern.

---

## W

### Wake
Both a funeral vigil (Irish tradition) and an awakening. Tim Finnegan's wake is his funeral; but he wakes (rises) when whiskey is spilled on him. The book is both a death watch and a celebration of renewal.

### Waywords and Meansigns
Project that set the complete Wake to music (2015-2017). 70+ hours of audio, free at [waywordsandmeansigns.com](https://waywordsandmeansigns.com).

### Work in Progress
Joyce's title for the Wake during its seventeen years of composition (1922-1939). Published in fragments in magazines before the complete book appeared.
