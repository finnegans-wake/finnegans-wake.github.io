## Print Concordances

### A Concordance to Finnegans Wake
**Clive Hart (1963)**

The foundational concordance, first published by University of Minnesota Press.

**Contains:**
1. **Complete Word Index** — Every word alphabetically with page.line locations
2. **Syllabification List** — Inner parts of compound words
3. **Distortion List** — 10,000+ English words suggested by Joyce's neologisms

**Example Entry:**
```
riverrun  3.01
rivers    196.01, 196.07, 213.11...
```

**Why It Matters:** Before FWEET, this was the only way to track word usage across the Wake. Still valuable for its syllabification analysis.

**ISBN:** 978-0816657407

## Specialized Lexicons

These function as concordances for specific languages or character types.

### A Gaelic Lexicon for Finnegans Wake
**Brendan O Hehir (1967)**

Every Irish word, phrase, and construction indexed by page and line. Includes translations, grammatical notes, and cultural context.

**Coverage:**
- Irish names and places
- Gaelic grammatical structures
- Irish mythology references
- Hiberno-English constructions

### Third Census of Finnegans Wake
**Adaline Glasheen (1977)**

Concordance of characters rather than words. Every person—real, fictional, or mythological—indexed with:
- All appearances (page.line)
- Alternative names
- Historical/literary sources
- Relationships to other characters

**Why Essential:** Characters in the Wake transform constantly. HCE becomes Wellington becomes Adam becomes Finn. The Census tracks these transformations.

### A Lexicon of the German in Finnegans Wake
**Helmut Bonheim (1967)**

German vocabulary indexed. Includes compound words, cognates, and German-English puns.

## Using Concordances

### Finding Patterns
Search for a word to see how Joyce uses it across the book:
- Does "river" cluster in certain chapters?
- How many variants of "HCE" appear?
- Where does "thunder" occur?

### Tracking Motifs
Concordances reveal the Wake's web of connections:
- "Letter" appears throughout—tracking it reveals a hidden narrative
- "Fall" variants cluster around HCE's crime
- River names concentrate in Book I, Chapter 8

### Building Vocabulary
Browse the concordance to discover Joyce's neologisms:
- What words did he invent?
- How do portmanteau words vary?
- What are the most frequent unusual terms?

### Cross-Reference Research
Use multiple resources together:
1. Find a word in the concordance
2. Check its annotation in FWEET or McHugh
3. Read the passage in context
4. Check the Census for character connections
