# Wake Vocabulary

*Finnegans Wake* is written in a unique language—English infused with 60+ other languages, portmanteau words, puns, and neologisms. Understanding Joyce's vocabulary is key to reading the Wake.

## The Language of the Wake

Joyce didn't write in English. He wrote in **Wakese**:

> "a language so to speak of sheds and stones" (p. 73)

This language is:
- **Multilingual**: 60–80 languages woven together
- **Punning**: Every word carries multiple meanings
- **Musical**: Sound often matters more than sense
- **Dreamlike**: Words merge and shift like dream images

---

## Why This Language?

Joyce explained his method to his patron Harriet Shaw Weaver:

> "One great part of every human existence is passed in a state which cannot be rendered sensible by the use of wideawake language, cutanddry grammar and goahead plot."

The Wake represents **dream consciousness**—where:
- Meanings overlap
- Words fuse
- Logic dissolves
- Everything connects to everything else

## Language Techniques

### 1. Portmanteau
Combining words (Lewis Carroll's term from *Through the Looking-Glass*):

| Portmanteau | Components | Meaning |
|-------------|------------|---------|
| **Ethiquetical** | Ethical + Etiquette | Morally proper |
| **Sinse** | Sin + Since + Sense | Guilty knowledge |
| **Collideorscape** | Collide + Kaleidoscope | Crashing colors |

### 2. Multilingual Puns
One word sounds like words in multiple languages:

| Word | English | Other Language |
|------|---------|----------------|
| **Mishe mishe** | "Me, me" | Irish *mise* (I am) |
| **Tauf tauf** | Tough | German *Taufe* (baptism) |
| **Annos** | Years (Latin *annos*) | Irish *anois* (now) |

### 3. Sound Symbolism
Words that sound like their meaning:
- **bababadalgharaghtakammina...** — the crash of thunder/fall
- **Liffey** — the flowing river
- **Sniffer** — nasal, curious

### 4. Letter Play
Manipulating letters and spellings:
- **HCE** hidden in words: "Howth Castle and Environs"
- **ALP** hidden: "Anna Livia Plurabelle"
- Reversed spellings, anagrams, acrostics

## The Multilingual Texture

Joyce embedded dozens of languages:

### Primary Languages
| Language | Frequency | Example |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| **English** | Base | Most words |
| **Irish/Gaelic** | Very high | *Mise*, *Éire*, *Fianna* |
| **Latin** | High | Religious, legal terms |
| **French** | High | *Belle*, *rivière*, *noir* |
| **German** | Medium | *Nacht*, *Vater*, *Wasser* |
| **Italian** | Medium | Musical terms, Dante |

### Other Languages
Norwegian, Danish, Dutch, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, Greek, Hebrew, Arabic, Sanskrit, Japanese, Chinese, Swahili, and many more.

### River Names (I.8)
The Anna Livia Plurabelle chapter contains **500+ river names** from around the world, woven into the prose.

## Decoding Strategies

### 1. Read Aloud
Many puns only work when **spoken**:
- "Bygmester Finnegan" sounds like "Big Master Finnegan"
- "The fall" sounds like "default"

### 2. Look for Familiar Roots
Beneath the distortion, English words hide:
- "Hesitency" = Hesitancy (HCE stammers)
- "Collideorscape" = Collide + Kaleidoscope

### 3. Check Multiple Languages
Use resources like:
- [FWEET](http://fweet.org) — Multilingual annotations
- McHugh's *Annotations* — Page-by-page translations

### 4. Accept Multiplicity
Words mean **many things at once**. Don't choose one meaning—hold them all.

## Famous Wake Words

### Quark
> "Three quarks for Muster Mark!" (p. 383)

Murray Gell-Mann named the subatomic particle after this word. In Joyce:
- Quark = German *Quark* (curd cheese, nonsense)
- Quark = Cry of a gull
- Three quarks = The three children? Three colors?

### Monomyth
> "the monomyth" (p. 581)

Joseph Campbell borrowed this term for *The Hero with a Thousand Faces*—the single story underlying all myths.

### Chaosmos
> "chaosmos" (p. 118)

Umberto Eco wrote a book using this term. Chaos + Cosmos = the ordered disorder of reality.

## The Numbers in Words

Joyce embeds numbers in vocabulary:

| Number | Appearance | Meaning |
|--------|------------|---------|
| **1** | "one," "won," "wan" | Unity, HCE |
| **2** | "too," "two," "tu" | Duality, twins |
| **3** | "tree," "trois," "drei" | Trinity, soldiers |
| **4** | "four," "for," "fore" | Evangelists, masters |
| **7** | "seven," "sept" | Rainbow, days |
| **11** | "eleventh" | Renewal |
| **28** | "twentyate" | Issy's girls |
| **100** | In thunderwords | Century |
| **1132** | "Thousandfirst" | Fall number |
