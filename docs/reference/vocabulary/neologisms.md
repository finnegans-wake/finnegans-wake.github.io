# Key Neologisms

Joyce invented words that have escaped *Finnegans Wake* and entered broader culture. These neologisms—newly coined terms—demonstrate the Wake's lasting influence on language.

## Words That Escaped

### Quark

> "Three quarks for Muster Mark!" (p. 383)

#### In the Wake
The word appears in a song mocking King Mark (the cuckold in the Tristan legend):
- **Quark**: German for "curd cheese" or "nonsense"
- **Quark**: Possibly the cry of a gull
- **Three**: The recurring number (three soldiers, trinity)

#### In Physics
In 1964, physicist **Murray Gell-Mann** named the elementary particle after Joyce's word:
- Quarks come in **three colors** (red, green, blue)
- Quarks come in **three generations**
- "Three quarks" fit perfectly

Gell-Mann later said he had the sound "kwork" in mind and found Joyce's spelling convenient.

#### Legacy
Every physics textbook now contains a word from *Finnegans Wake*.

---

### Monomyth

> "the monomyth" (p. 581)

#### In the Wake
Joyce uses it once, suggesting the single underlying myth.

#### In Mythology
**Joseph Campbell** borrowed the term for *The Hero with a Thousand Faces* (1949):
- The **monomyth** is the universal hero's journey
- All myths are variations of one story
- Departure → Initiation → Return

Campbell acknowledged Joyce's influence; the Wake's method of layering myths demonstrated the monomyth in action.

#### Legacy
"The hero's journey" / "monomyth" is now standard in storytelling theory, screenwriting, and literary studies.

---

### Chaosmos

> "chaosmos" (p. 118)

#### In the Wake
The universe as simultaneously chaotic and ordered—not chaos *or* cosmos, but both at once.

#### In Philosophy
**Gilles Deleuze** used the term in his philosophy of difference.

**Umberto Eco** wrote *The Aesthetics of Chaosmos* (1982), applying the concept to Joyce's work.

#### Legacy
The term appears in chaos theory discussions, postmodern philosophy, and literary criticism.

## Significant Coinages

### Fadograph

> "fadograph of a yestern scene" (p. 569)

| Component | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **Faded** | Dim, aged |
| **Photograph** | Light-writing, image |
| **Graph** | Writing, record |

A photograph that has faded—memory becoming indistinct. The word captures how images (and memories) decay over time.

---

### Collideorscape

> "collideorscape" (p. 143)

| Component | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **Collide** | Crash, meet violently |
| **Kaleidoscope** | Shifting color pattern |
| **Escape** | Flight |
| **Or** | Alternative |

A kaleidoscope of collisions—the Wake's method of crashing images together to create shifting patterns.

---

### Laughtears

> "laughtears" (p. 15)

| Component | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **Laughter** | Joy expression |
| **Tears** | Sorrow expression |

The simultaneous experience of laughing and crying—tragicomedy condensed into one word. The wake (funeral) that is also a party.

---

### Cropse

> "Hohohoho, Mister Finn, you're going to be Mister Finnagain! Comeday morm and, O, you're vine! Sendday's eve and, ah, you're vinegar! Hahahaha, Mister Funn, you're going to be fined again!" (p. 5)

The pun on "corpse" + "crops" (what grows from death) appears throughout. Death feeds new life.

---

### Riverrun

> "riverrun, past Eve and Adam's, from swerve of shore to bend of bay..." (p. 3)

The famous opening word:
| Component | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **River** | The Liffey, water, flow |
| **Run** | Movement, course, operation |
| **Rerun** | Repetition, return |

The word is now iconic—it appears in book titles, band names, and countless references.

---

### Contransmagnificandjewbangtantiality

> "the contransmagnificandjewbangtantiality" (p. 94)

One of Joyce's longest coinages:
- **Contra**: Against
- **Trans**: Across
- **Magnific**: Great
- **And**: Conjunction
- **Jew**: Jewish
- **Bang**: Explosion
- **Tant**: So much (French)
- **Tiality**: Abstract suffix

Parodies scholastic philosophy's abstract terminology—the grand nonsense of metaphysical jargon.

---

## Technical Innovations

### Funferall

> "funferall" (p. 13)

| Component | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **Fun** | Enjoyment |
| **Funeral** | Death ceremony |
| **For all** | Universal |

The Irish wake as both mourning and celebration. Death is fun for all.

---

### Proteiform

> "a proteiform graph" (p. 107)

| Component | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **Proteus** | The shape-shifting god |
| **Protein** | Building block of life |
| **Form** | Shape, structure |

Shape-shifting, ever-changing—describes both the letter and the Wake itself.

---

### Heliotrope

Joyce didn't invent this word, but his use in *Ulysses* ("the word known to all men") gave it literary fame. In the Wake, flower/sun imagery continues with invented variations.

---

## Wordplay Techniques

### Telescoping
Jamming words together:
- **Bringastoringaling** (p. 328) = Bring + As + To + Ring + A + Ling + Lingam

### Contamination
One word "infects" another:
- **Sinse** (p. 4) = Sin contaminates "since" and "sense"

### Macaronic
Mixing languages in one word:
- **Chapelizod** = Chapel + Iseult (Isolde) + Od (Norse god)

### Backformation
Creating words that sound like they should exist:
- **Topsawyer** (p. 24) = Top + Sawyer (as if "top" comes from sawing)

---

## Words and Concepts

### The Wake's Vocabulary as Philosophy

Joyce's neologisms aren't just playful—they embody philosophical positions:

| Word | Philosophy |
|------|------------|
| **Chaosmos** | Order and chaos are one |
| **Riverrun** | Time is circular |
| **Laughtears** | Opposites coincide |
| **Funferall** | Death is life |

Bruno's coincidence of opposites becomes linguistic practice.
