# Portmanteau Words

A portmanteau word combines two or more words into one, carrying the meanings of both. Lewis Carroll coined the term in *Through the Looking-Glass* (1871). Joyce made it a primary technique.

## What Is a Portmanteau?

Humpty Dumpty explains to Alice:

> "You see it's like a portmanteau—there are two meanings packed up into one word."

Carroll's examples:
- **Slithy** = Slimy + Lithe
- **Mimsy** = Miserable + Flimsy

Joyce took this much further.

## Joyce's Portmanteau Method

Joyce's portmanteaus typically:
- Combine **2–5 words**
- Draw from **multiple languages**
- Create **new meanings** beyond the sum of parts
- Carry **thematic weight**

### Example: "Chaosmos"
> "chaosmos" (p. 118)

| Component | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **Chaos** | Disorder, primordial void |
| **Cosmos** | Order, universe |
| **Combined** | The universe as ordered chaos |

This single word captures Joyce's worldview: reality is both chaotic and ordered.

## Major Portmanteaus

| Component | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **River** | The Liffey, ALP, flow |
| **Run** | Movement, course |
| **Rerun** | Repetition, cycle |

The first word announces: this is a flowing, repeating text.

#### Alongthe (p. 628)

The final fragmented words suggest:

## Creating Meaning

Portmanteaus don't just combine—they create:

### Addition
> **Laughtears** = Laughter + Tears

But the meaning isn't just "laughter and tears"—it's the **simultaneous experience** of both, the tragicomic moment.

### Multiplication
> **Chaosmos** = Chaos × Cosmos

The meaning multiplies: not chaos *or* cosmos, but chaos-*as*-cosmos, order-within-disorder.

### Transformation
> **Riverrun** = River → Run → Rerun

Each component transforms the others: the river runs, the text reruns, the cycle rivers.

## Reading Portmanteaus

### Strategy 1: Sound It Out
Many portmanteaus reveal themselves when spoken:
- "Collideorscape" → hear "kaleidoscope"
- "Funferall" → hear "funeral"

### Strategy 2: Look for Roots
Find familiar word-parts:
- "Chaosmos" → "chaos" + "cosmos"
- "Proteiform" → "Proteus" + "form"

### Strategy 3: Check Languages
Consult multilingual resources:
- McHugh's *Annotations*
- [FWEET](http://fweet.org)

### Strategy 4: Accept Multiplicity
Hold all meanings simultaneously. The richness is the point.
