# Digital Archives

Digital humanities projects have transformed Wake scholarship. These archives provide access to manuscripts, drafts, and compositional materials.

The premier digital resource for Joyce's compositional process.

### What It Contains
- Complete compositional history of *Finnegans Wake*
- Interactive draft viewing
- Notebook transcriptions

### How to Use It
1. Navigate to the *Finnegans Wake* section

### Why It Matters
The JJDA lets you "watch the text write itself" from Joyce's earliest notes through multiple drafts to final form. Essential for understanding Joyce's methods and intentions.
