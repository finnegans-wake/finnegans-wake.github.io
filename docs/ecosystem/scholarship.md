# Scholarship

*Finnegans Wake* scholarship continues to evolve 85+ years after publication. 2024 marked a significant anniversary: the centenary of the first Wake excerpt's publication in the April 1924 *transatlantic review*.

## Recent Publications (2024-2025)

### Finnegans Wake: Human and Nonhuman Histories
**Edinburgh University Press, 2024**
Edited by Richard Barlow and Paul Fagan

Twelve new essays by leading Joyce scholars exploring conjunctions between human and nonhuman in Joyce's final novel:
- Fossil fuels, storms, water, bodily fluids
- The Irish Revival, skin, wolves, mourning
- Genes, memes, atoms, television, music
- The Anthropocene and Joyce's working practices

Praised as "fizzing with ideas" and "a revitalizing contribution to Wake studies."

## Key Scholarly Debates

### Interpretation vs. Annotation
McHugh provides minimal interpretation; Campbell offers maximal interpretation. The field continues to negotiate this tension.

### The "Meaning" Question
- **Strong determinism:** Every word has specific intended meaning
- **Pluralism:** Multiple valid meanings coexist
- **Anti-interpretation:** The experience matters more than meaning

### Authority of the Text
- The 1939 first edition has known errors
- Joyce continued revising until death
- Genetic critics argue drafts are equally important

### Environmental Joyce
Growing recognition of Joyce's engagement with:
- Dublin's rivers and landscape
- Urban ecology and planning
- Human-nonhuman relations
