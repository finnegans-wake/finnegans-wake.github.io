## Starting Your Own Group

### Format Options

| Format | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| One page/session | Deep; thorough | Slow (years to finish) |
| One chapter/month | Good pace | Less depth |
| Thematic | Focused | Requires planning |
| Audio-first | Accessible | Less annotation time |

### Practical Considerations

1. **Size:** 4-10 people works well
2. **Consistency:** Same time, same place
3. **Preparation:** Decide if homework is required
4. **Leadership:** Rotate or designate a facilitator
5. **Resources:** Ensure everyone has the same edition (Viking/Penguin)

### Session Structure (Example: 2 hours)

1. **Reading aloud** (30 min) — Take turns reading the assigned pages
2. **First reactions** (15 min) — What struck you?
3. **Annotation review** (30 min) — Check FWEET/McHugh for key passages
4. **Discussion** (30 min) — Themes, connections, questions
5. **Preview next session** (15 min) — What to read; any preparation?

## The Reading Group Tradition

Groups have been reading the Wake together since 1939:

> "The book is more than 400 pages long, and it's not unusual for reading groups to spend a full session dissecting just a page or two. In 2010, one group in Boston celebrated the end of the novel with booze and a ritual chant; the members had been working their way through the book for 13 years."
>
> — Smithsonian Magazine

One group completed the Wake after 28 years—and immediately started again.

This is a living tradition. Join it.
