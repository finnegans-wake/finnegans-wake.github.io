# Structure

*Finnegans Wake* has a deliberate, intricate structure based on Vico's cyclical theory of history.

## Overview

The book divides into four parts corresponding to Vico's four ages:

| Part | Chapters | Pages | Vico Age | Time of Night |
|------|----------|-------|----------|---------------|
| I | 8 chapters | 3-216 | Theocratic | Evening |
| II | 4 chapters | 219-399 | Aristocratic | Midnight |
| III | 4 chapters | 403-590 | Democratic | Deep night |
| IV | 1 chapter | 593-628 | Ricorso | Dawn |

## Part I: The Parents (pp. 3-216)

The theocratic age of giants and gods. Focus on HCE's fall and ALP's defense.

### I.1 (pp. 3-29) — *Finnegan's Fall*
The book's overture. Tim Finnegan falls from a ladder; his wake is held; HCE is introduced as the sleeping giant under Dublin.

### I.2 (pp. 30-47) — *HCE's Encounter*
HCE meets a cad in Phoenix Park who asks the time. This innocent encounter becomes the seed of rumor and scandal.

### I.3 (pp. 48-74) — *The Rumors Spread*
The story of HCE's crime spreads through Dublin, growing and changing. His guilt multiplies through telling.

### I.4 (pp. 75-103) — *The Trial*
HCE is tried (in dream-court) for his crimes. Multiple witnesses. No clear verdict.

### I.5 (pp. 104-125) — *The Letter*
Analysis of the letter ALP wrote defending HCE. The letter (found in a rubbish heap) may be the Wake itself.

### I.6 (pp. 126-168) — *Questions and Answers*
Twelve questions about the characters and themes, answered in the Wake's characteristic style.

### I.7 (pp. 169-195) — *Shem the Penman*
Portrait of the artist as Shem, Joyce's self-caricature. Written in relatively accessible satirical prose.

### I.8 (pp. 196-216) — *Anna Livia Plurabelle*
Two washerwomen gossip about ALP while doing laundry in the Liffey. The most famous and lyrical chapter.

## Part II: The Children (pp. 219-399)

The aristocratic age of heroes. Focus shifts to the children and their conflicts.

### II.1 (pp. 219-259) — *The Children's Hour*
The children play in the street. "The Mime of Mick, Nick and the Maggies" — a game/play about the twins' conflict over Issy.

### II.2 (pp. 260-308) — *Night Lessons*
The children do homework. Marginal notes by Shem (left) and Shaun (right) comment on the central text. Footnotes by Issy. An encyclopedic chapter.

### II.3 (pp. 309-382) — *In the Pub*
Scene in HCE's pub. Patrons tell stories. HCE defends himself. The radio plays. Ends with HCE passing out drunk.

### II.4 (pp. 383-399) — *Mamalujo*
The four old men (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John) watch Tristan and Isolde's love scene on a ship.

## Part III: Shaun (pp. 403-590)

The democratic age. Shaun's rise and HCE's decline.

### III.1 (pp. 403-428) — *Shaun the Post*
Shaun as postman delivers ALP's letter. He's asked about his brother Shem and responds with hostility.

### III.2 (pp. 429-473) — *Jaun's Sermon*
Shaun (as Jaun) preaches to Issy and her classmates, mixing religious instruction with barely suppressed desire.

### III.3 (pp. 474-554) — *Yawn's Inquest*
The four old men interrogate Shaun (now deflated as Yawn). Voices of HCE and ALP emerge. HCE's long self-defense.

### III.4 (pp. 555-590) — *In the Bedroom*
The parents in bed. Sexual activity (or its memory). The children nearby. Dawn approaches.

## Part IV: The Ricorso (pp. 593-628)

The return. One chapter bridging night and day, death and rebirth.

### IV.1 (pp. 593-628) — *Dawn*
Morning comes. Kevin appears. ALP's final monologue as the river flows to sea. The sentence breaks off, returning to page 3.

## The Circular Structure

The book's most famous feature: the last sentence ("A way a lone a last a loved a long the") continues into the first ("riverrun, past Eve and Adam's...").

This creates:
- **Eternal recurrence** — the book never ends
- **Dream logic** — dreams loop and repeat
- **Vico's ricorso** — history cycles
- **River to sea to rain to river** — natural cycles
