# Joseph Campbell & Finnegans Wake

Joseph Campbell (1904–1987), the mythologist best known for *The Hero with a Thousand Faces*, had a lifelong relationship with James Joyce's work—particularly *Finnegans Wake*. Campbell's first book was *A Skeleton Key to Finnegans Wake* (1944), and he borrowed the very term "monomyth" from Joyce's novel.

## The Origin: Paris, 1927

In 1927, as a twenty-three-year-old postgraduate scholar in Paris, Campbell first encountered *Ulysses*. Confused but intrigued, he visited Sylvia Beach's Shakespeare & Company bookstore—the original publisher of *Ulysses*—where Beach gave him "clues" for reading Joyce. Campbell later attested that this encounter changed his entire career.

For the next sixty years, Campbell moved through the labyrinths of Joyce's creations, using depth psychology, comparative religion, anthropology, and art history as tools of analysis.

## A Skeleton Key to Finnegans Wake (1944)

### The First Comprehensive Guide

Campbell's first book, co-authored with poet and *Reader's Digest* editor Henry Morton Robinson, was the first major guide to *Finnegans Wake*. Published just five years before *The Hero with a Thousand Faces*, it established Campbell as a Joyce scholar.

| Detail | Information |
|--------|-------------|
| Authors | Joseph Campbell & Henry Morton Robinson |
| Published | 1944 (Harcourt, Brace & Co.) |
| Editions | Multiple; 2013 edition with foreword by Edmund L. Epstein |
| Format | Available in print, ebook, and audiobook |

### What the Skeleton Key Provides

- **Running synopsis** of the entire novel
- **Exegetical outline** following the text page by page
- **Vico interpretation**: The Wake read through Giambattista Vico's cyclical theory of history
- **Character guide**: Identifying recurring figures (HCE, ALP, Shem, Shaun, Issy)
- **Thematic analysis**: Dreams, cycles, resurrection

### The Vico Framework

Campbell and Robinson interpreted the Wake primarily through the lens of Giambattista Vico's *La Scienza Nuova* (1725), which proposed that history moves through recurring cycles:

1. **Age of Gods** (theocratic)
2. **Age of Heroes** (aristocratic)
3. **Age of Humans** (democratic)
4. **Ricorso** (dissolution/return)

Joyce structured the Wake's four books to mirror this pattern, with ten "thunderwords" (hundred-letter portmanteau words) marking transitions between ages—just as Vico said thunderclaps announced each age.

### Contemporary Reception

The *Skeleton Key* was widely praised:

> "Campbell and Robinson deserve a citation from the Republic of Letters."
> — Edmund Wilson, *The New Yorker*

> "Joyce has found in Mr. Campbell and Mr. Robinson the ideal readers."
> — Max Lerner, *The New York Times*

## The Skin of Our Teeth Controversy (1942–1943)

### How the Skeleton Key Began

Campbell and Robinson's intensive study of *Finnegans Wake* began when they recognized extensive borrowings in Thornton Wilder's Pulitzer Prize-winning play *The Skin of Our Teeth* (1942).

The play—about the Antrobus family surviving ice ages, floods, and wars—drew heavily on Wake themes, structure, and even language. Campbell and Robinson saw this as plagiarism.

### The Saturday Review Articles

They published two articles in *The Saturday Review of Literature*:

1. **"The Skin of Whose Teeth?"** (December 19, 1942)
2. **"The Skin of Whose Teeth? Part 2: The Intention Behind the Deed"** (February 13, 1943)

The articles created a literary firestorm. *The New Yorker*'s Wolcott Gibbs satirized the controversy in a piece called "Finnegan's Teeth."

### Wilder's Defense

Thornton Wilder—himself an early champion of *Finnegans Wake*—freely acknowledged Joyce's influence but denied plagiarism:

> "From Joyce I received the idea of presenting ancient man as an ever-present double to modern man."

Wilder had written to Gertrude Stein in August 1939 about his absorption in "digging out [the Wake's] buried keys and resolving that unbroken chain of erudite puzzles."

Subsequent critics have vindicated Wilder, but some argue the controversy may have cost him the Nobel Prize.

## The Monomyth: A Term from Joyce

One of Campbell's most famous concepts—the "monomyth" or "hero's journey"—comes directly from *Finnegans Wake*.

### Joyce's Word

In the Wake, Joyce writes of "the monomyth" as a portmanteau combining:
- **Monolith** (a single great stone)
- **Monomythos** (Greek: a single story/speech)

### Campbell's Application

In *The Hero with a Thousand Faces* (1949), Campbell used the term to describe the universal pattern underlying hero stories across cultures:

> Departure → Initiation → Return

Campbell saw Joyce as attempting to encode all of world mythology and religion into a single text—hence "monomyth."

The concept influenced George Lucas (*Star Wars*), Christopher Vogler (*The Writer's Journey*), and countless storytellers.

## Reading the Wake with Campbell

### Campbell's Approach

Campbell read the Wake as:

1. **A dream** — The night-consciousness of humanity
2. **A cycle** — Following Vico's historical pattern
3. **A myth** — Encoding universal patterns
4. **An Irish story** — HCE as modern Finn MacCool
5. **A comedy** — Fundamentally life-affirming

### Tips from Campbell

> "Finnegans Wake is the dream of old Finn, lying in death beside the River Liffey and watching the history of Ireland and the world—past and future—flow through his mind like flotsam on the river of life."

Campbell advised readers to:

- Read aloud to hear the music
- Accept that not everything needs to be "understood"
- Follow recurring themes across the text
- Use the Vico structure as a map

---

## Campbell and Contemporary Wake Studies

### Influence on Later Scholarship

Campbell and Robinson's *Skeleton Key* remains foundational, though later critics have challenged aspects:

- **Interpretation vs. annotation**: McHugh's *Annotations* offers less interpretation than Campbell
- **The "meaning" question**: Campbell assumed determinate meanings; later critics embrace pluralism
- **Vico centrality**: Some argue Campbell overemphasizes Vico at the expense of other frameworks

### Contemporary Editions

The 2013 edition of *A Skeleton Key* includes:

- Foreword by Edmund L. Epstein
- Corrections to the original text
- Updated bibliography

## Key Quotes from Campbell on Joyce

> "Joyce's work makes a definitive statement about life: an affirmation of life in the face of the whole spectacle of its horror."

> "Finnegans Wake is a book about the night world, the world of dream and the mythological unconscious."

> "Joyce is the literary culmination of an entire development of art that I call 'the affirmation of all things.'"
