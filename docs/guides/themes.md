# Key Themes

*Finnegans Wake* weaves together numerous themes and motifs. These are the most prominent.

## The Fall

The central event of the Wake is a fall—or rather, all falls:

- **HCE's mysterious transgression** in Phoenix Park
- **Adam's fall** from Eden
- **Lucifer's fall** from Heaven
- **Humpty Dumpty's fall** from the wall
- **Tim Finnegan's fall** from a ladder (the ballad)
- **Napoleon at Waterloo**
- **Parnell's political fall**
- **The Fall of Rome**

All falls are one fall. The dreamer HCE relives humanity's primal guilt through endless variations.

### The Crime in the Park
HCE's specific transgression is never clearly stated. He may have:
- Exposed himself to two girls
- Voyeuristically watched urinating soldiers
- Committed some sexual impropriety
- Done nothing at all (the guilt is existential)

The ambiguity is essential. The crime is the human condition.

## Resurrection and Renewal

Every fall implies a rise. The Wake's structure embodies eternal return:

- **Finn MacCool** lies sleeping under Dublin, ready to wake
- **Tim Finnegan** rises at his wake when whiskey is spilled on him
- **The Phoenix** rises from ashes (Phoenix Park)
- **Easter** and Christian resurrection
- **Dawn** ends the night's dream
- **The final sentence** returns to the first

## The Family

The Wake centers on a Dublin family that is also every family:

### HCE (Humphrey Chimpden Earwicker)
- **The Father** — authority, guilt, decline
- **Adam** — the first man, the first sinner
- **Finn MacCool** — the sleeping giant
- **Chapelizod publican** — the social role
- Sigla: **⊓** (like a mountain)

### ALP (Anna Livia Plurabelle)
- **The Mother** — creativity, forgiveness, flow
- **Eve** — the first woman, origin of life
- **The River Liffey** — Dublin's river, all rivers
- **The Letter** — her defense of HCE
- Sigla: **∆** (like a delta/triangle)

### Shem and Shaun (the Twins)
- **Shem** — the artist, introvert, Penman, Joyce himself
- **Shaun** — the postman, extrovert, man of action
- **Cain and Abel**, Jacob and Esau, all brother conflicts
- Always opposed, always interchangeable
- Sigla: **⌐** (Shem) and **⌐** reversed (Shaun)

### Issy (Isolde)
- **The Daughter** — youth, sexuality, mirror
- **Isolde** — the beloved, object of desire
- **Split personality** — often appears as two (with her mirror image)
- Sigla: **⊣**

## Time and History

### Vico's Cycles
History repeats in four-stage cycles:
1. Theocratic (gods and thunder)
2. Aristocratic (heroes and fathers)
3. Democratic (equality and reason)
4. Ricorso (chaos, then return to stage 1)

### Eternal Recurrence
Nothing is ever over. The Wake's circular structure—final sentence leading to first—embodies Nietzsche's eternal return and Joyce's vision of history as nightmare from which we're trying to awake.

### All History Simultaneous
The Wake collapses time. Wellington's battle is Caesar's is HCE's pub brawl. The techniques of dream allow all moments to coexist.

## Language and Communication

### The Letter
ALP writes a letter defending HCE against accusations. This letter:
- Is found in a midden heap by a hen
- Contains the truth about the crime (maybe)
- Is analyzed extensively (I.5)
- Is the Wake itself (perhaps)
- Is Joyce's work, scratched from rubbish

### Babel and Tongues
The Wake uses 60+ languages because:
- Dreams don't respect linguistic boundaries
- All languages share deep structures
- Joyce aimed for universal communication
- The Tower of Babel is a recurring motif

## The Body and Sexuality

### Bodily Geography
Dublin's landscape maps onto the sleeping body:
- **Howth Head** = HCE's head
- **Phoenix Park** = the torso
- **The Liffey** = various flowing aspects
- **Chapelizod** = the chapel of Isolde

### Sexuality and Guilt
HCE's guilt is fundamentally sexual:
- Incestuous desire for Issy
- Voyeurism and exhibitionism
- Sexual jealousy of the sons
- The creative/procreative link

## Water and Rivers

Anna Livia is the Liffey, but also:
- All rivers (the chapter names 500+ rivers)
- The flow of time
- The flow of language
- Female creativity and nurturing
- The return to the sea (death)

## Death and Wake

A "wake" is both:
- **A funeral vigil** — watching over the dead
- **An awakening** — to wake up
- **A ship's wake** — the trail behind

Tim Finnegan's wake is both his funeral and his resurrection. The book is a vigil over Western civilization and a celebration of its perpetual renewal.
