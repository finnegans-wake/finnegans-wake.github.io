# Giordano Bruno

Giordano Bruno (1548–1600) was an Italian philosopher burned at the stake for heresy. His concept of the **coincidence of opposites** (*coincidentia oppositorum*) is fundamental to *Finnegans Wake*'s structure and logic.

## Who Was Bruno?

**Giordano Bruno** was a Dominican friar who became a radical philosopher:

- Born in **Nola**, near Naples (Joyce calls him "the Nolan")
- Proposed an **infinite universe** with many worlds
- Developed the theory of **coincidentia oppositorum**
- Burned at the stake in Rome, 1600, for heresy

Joyce discovered Bruno as a student and remained fascinated throughout his life.

---

## The Coincidence of Opposites

Bruno's central idea: **opposites are ultimately identical**.

### The Principle
At their extremes, contraries meet and become one:
- The maximum and minimum coincide
- The infinitely large circle becomes a straight line
- Hot and cold are degrees of the same quality
- Love and hate are forms of the same passion

### The Formula
> "In the infinite, all things are one."

What seems opposite is actually unified at a deeper level.

---

## Bruno in the Wake

Joyce applies Bruno's logic throughout:

### Shem and Shaun
The twins appear as opposites:

| Shem | Shaun |
|------|-------|
| Artist | Postman |
| Introvert | Extrovert |
| Creator | Deliverer |
| Time | Space |

But they are **the same person split**:
- They merge at moments
- Each contains the other
- Their conflict is internal
- One cannot exist without the other

### Other Brunonian Pairs
| Pair | Opposition | Unity |
|------|------------|-------|
| HCE / ALP | Male / Female | Marriage |
| Day / Night | Light / Dark | The cycle |
| Fall / Rise | Death / Rebirth | The pattern |
| Guilt / Innocence | Accused / Defender | HCE's condition |

---

## "The Nolan"

Joyce refers to Bruno as "the Nolan" (from his birthplace, Nola):

> "His producers are they not sodality of Doyle? And that our playbill is a broderick!" (p. 293)

Hidden: "Bruno of Nola" in the Irish names Doyle (Dublin) and Broderick.

### The Dublin Connection
Joyce punned Bruno with **Bruno the Dublin bookseller** (Browne and Nolan, a real Dublin firm):

- **Browne and Nolan** = Bruno of Nola
- The bookshop becomes the philosopher
- Dublin commerce encodes Italian heresy

---

## Bruno's Infinite Universe

Bruno proposed:
- The universe is **infinite**
- There are **innumerable worlds**
- Earth is not the center
- God is immanent in all things

### In the Wake
The Wake contains:
- Infinite interpretations
- Innumerable versions of the same story
- No privileged center
- The divine in the mundane

---

## The Minimum and Maximum

Bruno argued that at extremes, the minimum and maximum coincide:

> "The minimum coincides with the maximum."

### Mathematical Image
- An infinitely large circle has no curvature—it's a straight line
- The smallest arc equals the smallest chord
- Extremes meet

### In the Wake
- The beginning (p. 3) is the end (p. 628)
- The father (HCE) contains the sons
- The individual is universal ("Here Comes Everybody")
- The smallest detail contains the whole

---

## Bruno and the Twins

The Shem/Shaun conflict embodies Brunonian logic:

### Opposition
They fight throughout:
- The Mookse and the Gripes (I.6)
- The Ondt and the Gracehoper (III.1)
- Dolph and Kev (II.2)
- Butt and Taff (II.3)

### Identity
But they are **one person**:
- Both are sons of HCE
- Both desire Issy
- Both will become the father
- Their opposition is a unity

### The Resolution
Bruno's logic suggests their conflict will resolve not through victory but through **coincidence**—they will become each other.

---

## Coincidentia Oppositorum in Practice

### Reading Strategy
When you encounter opposites in the Wake, assume they are **secretly unified**:

| Apparent Opposition | Hidden Unity |
|--------------------|--------------|
| Past / Future | The eternal present |
| Sacred / Profane | The sacramental ordinary |
| Comedy / Tragedy | The same story |
| Sense / Nonsense | Meaning beyond logic |

### Example
> "The seim anew" (p. 215)

- "The same anew" — repetition
- "The Seine" — the river (ALP)
- Same/new coincide

---

## Bruno's Heresy

Bruno was burned for beliefs including:
- The infinity of worlds
- The mortality of the soul
- Denial of transubstantiation
- Pantheism

### Joyce's Sympathy
Joyce, who rejected Catholicism, identified with Bruno:
- The heretic as hero
- Truth against authority
- Martyrdom for ideas
- The outsider's vision

---

## Samuel Beckett on Bruno

In "Dante... Bruno. Vico.. Joyce" (1929), Beckett explained:

> "There is no difference, says Bruno, between the smallest possible chord and the smallest possible arc, no difference between the infinite circle and the straight line... The maxima and minima of particular contraries are one and indifferent."

Beckett saw Bruno as essential to understanding Joyce's method.

---

## Bruno and Vico Together

Joyce combined Bruno and Vico:

| Bruno | Vico |
|-------|------|
| Opposites coincide | History cycles |
| Spatial logic | Temporal logic |
| Synchronic | Diachronic |
| Unity of contraries | Return of phases |

Together they provide:
- **Bruno**: Everything is connected to its opposite
- **Vico**: Everything returns to its beginning

---

## Bruno's Influence on Language

Bruno influenced Joyce's **portmanteau words**:

### Coincidence in Language
A portmanteau combines opposites:
- "Chaosmos" = Chaos + Cosmos
- "Funferall" = Fun + Funeral
- "Phoenish" = Phoenix + Finish

### The Logic
If opposites coincide, then words containing opposites express deeper truth than words that separate them.

---

## Key Bruno Passages

### The Title
> "Doublends Jined" (p. 20)

"Double ends joined" — opposites meeting.

### The Twins
> "Shem and Shaun... Stemmed one and the same person" (II.2)

The brothers are one.

### The Circle
> "Teems of times and happy returns" (p. 215)

Time as circular return.

## Reading Bruno in the Wake

### Tips
1. **Expect opposites to merge** — Don't keep them separate
2. **Look for puns on "Nolan"** — Bruno appears in disguise
3. **Note the twins** — They embody Brunonian logic
4. **Accept contradiction** — It's the point, not a problem

### Exercise
When you find a pair of opposites, ask:
- How are they the same?
- What unites them?
- What would their coincidence mean?

---

## Bruno's Legacy

Bruno influenced:
- **Spinoza** — God as nature
- **Leibniz** — Monads and harmony
- **Hegel** — Dialectical logic
- **Joyce** — Coincidentia oppositorum

The Wake is perhaps the fullest literary expression of Bruno's philosophy.
