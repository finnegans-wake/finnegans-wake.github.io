description: How Joyce's language works in Finnegans Wake
---

# Language

The language of *Finnegans Wake* is Joyce's most radical innovation. Understanding how it works transforms the reading experience.

## Basic Principles

### English as Base
Despite appearances, English is the foundation. Most sentences follow English syntax. Most words have English roots. The additions and transformations overlay this base.

### Multilingual Punning
Joyce blends 60+ languages, creating words that mean multiple things simultaneously:

**Example: "chaosmos"** (page 118)
- chaos + cosmos
- The universe as beautiful disorder
- Order emerging from chaos

**Example: "bababadalgharaghtakamminarronnkonnbronntonnerronntuonnthunntrovarrhounawnskawntoohoohoordenenthurnuk"** (page 3)
- Thunder in multiple languages
- Marks Vico's thunder that began civilization
- 100 letters (there are 10 thunderwords totaling 1001 letters)

### Dream Logic
Words transform as in dreams:
- Names shift: HCE becomes "Here Comes Everybody," "Haveth Childers Everywhere," "Howth Castle and Environs"
- Languages blur: the dreamer doesn't distinguish tongues
- Meanings layer: every word carries multiple associations

## Word Formation Techniques

### Portmanteau Words
Two or more words combined:

| Word | Components | Meaning |
|------|------------|---------|
| funferall | fun + funeral | The fun of a funeral (Irish wake) |
| bisexycle | bisexual + bicycle | The cycling of sexual identity |
| collideorscape | collide + kaleidoscope | Collision of images |
| meandertale | meander + tale | Wandering story |

### Multilingual Puns

| Word | Languages | Meanings |
|------|-----------|----------|
| shemblable | Shem + Fr. semblable | Shem-like, similar |
| venissoon | Venice + Fr. venison + soon | Coming soon like deer |
| tolvtubular | twelve + tub + tubular | TV/radio (twelve tubes) |

### Embedded Names
Words contain hidden proper nouns:

- "heliotropically" contains "Eli" and "trope"
- "Dyoublong" = "Do you belong?" + "Dublin"
- "doublends" = "double ends" + "Dublin" (phonetically)

### Sound Patterns
Alliteration, assonance, and rhythm guide meaning:

> "Soft morning, city! Lsp! I am leafy speafing."

The sounds create meaning beyond the words.

## Reading Strategies for Language

### 1. Read Aloud
Many words become clear when pronounced:
- "Usqueadbaugham" = "uisce beatha" (Irish: whiskey) + Abraham
- "Comes the question are these the facts" = "Comes the question: are these the fácts?"

### 2. Irish English Pronunciation
Joyce's Dublin accent is embedded:
- "th" becomes "t" or "d"
- Vowels shift
- Rhythm is Irish

### 3. Sound Out Foreign Words
Joyce phoneticized foreign languages:
- "O foenix culprit!" = "O felix culpa!" (Latin: fortunate fall)
- "Cog it out" = "cogito" (Latin: I think)

### 4. Look for English Base
Under the distortion, find the English:
- "What clashes here of wills gen wonts" = "What clashes here of wills against wants"

## Language Families in the Wake

### Most Common
- **English** (base language)
- **Irish/Gaelic** (especially names, phrases)
- **Latin** (liturgical, classical)
- **French** (literary, courtly)
- **German** (philosophical, compound words)
- **Italian** (musical, operatic)

### Also Present
- Norwegian, Danish, Swedish
- Dutch, Flemish
- Spanish, Portuguese
- Greek (classical)
- Hebrew
- Sanskrit
- Japanese, Chinese
- Russian
- And dozens more...

## The Sigla

Joyce used symbols (sigla) to represent characters in his notes:

| Sigla | Character | Looks Like |
|-------|-----------|------------|
| ⊓ | HCE | Mountain/gate |
| ∆ | ALP | Triangle/delta |
| ⌐ | Shem | Half-square (reversed for Shaun) |
| ⊣ | Issy | Different orientation |
| X | Four old men | Cross/four points |

These appear in the text and help track characters.

## Recurring Words and Motifs

Certain words recur with accumulated meaning:

| Word | Significance |
|------|--------------|
| riverrun | Opening word; river running; rerun |
| phoenix | Resurrection; Phoenix Park |
| hundred | HCE's initials are numbers (H=100) |
| thousand | Completeness, ALP |
| meanderthalltale | The whole meandering tale |
