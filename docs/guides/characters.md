## Using the Third Census

Adaline Glasheen's *Third Census of Finnegans Wake* (1977) tracks every character appearance. For each name, it lists:
- All pages where the character appears
- Alternative names and forms
- Historical/mythological sources
- Relationships to other characters

This is essential for tracking characters through their transformations.
